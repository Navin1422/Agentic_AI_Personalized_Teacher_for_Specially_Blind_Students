Learning Objectives
 ● To understand large numbers and the terms used to represent them.
 ● To compare large numbers and order them.
 ● To employ estimation for large numbers.
 ● To solve word problems involving four fundamental operations.
 ● To understand and use the properties of Whole Numbers.
1.1 Introduction
Read the following conversation between two classmates.
Mani  :  (Reading Newspaper Headlines)  
“Ten thousand people visited the trade fair yesterday”.
Mallika :  Wow! That's a lot of people. 
Mani  :  Thank goodness, I went to the  
trade fair exactly yesterday!
Mallika :  Why… what is so important about it?
Mani  :  Don’t you see? If I had not gone, they 
would have written “Nine thousand 
nine hundred and ninety-nine people 
only visited the trade fair yesterday”. 
It would have been difficult to read and 
understand!
What do you think about this conversation? Was Mani right?
No! it would still be “Ten thousand people visited!”. Newspapers give (and readers want) 
a sense of the size, NOT exact values when numbers are large.
You have probably heard names like ‘lakhs’ and ‘crores’ used by elders.
We often come across situations that involve large numbers in real life, like the number 
of people living in a district, the budget of the Government, the distance of stars or the 
number of bicycles sold in a year and so on. In all these situations, we look for names that 
convey the “size” of these numbers.

MATHEMATICS ALIVE - LARGE NUMBERS IN REAL LIFE
Tamil Nadu has about 26,345 square 
kilometre of forest land.
The number of stars in the Milky way 
galaxy is about 20,000 crore
Let us understand the large numbers in detail, and the way they are connected to the 
numbers learnt earlier.
Recap of Successor and Predecessor
 ● When 1 is added to a number we get its Successor.
 ● When 1 is subtracted from a number we get its Predecessor.
TRY THESE
 ● 999 + 1 = _________.
 ● 10000 − 1 = _________.
 ● The Successor of 4576 is __________.
 ● The Predecessor of 8970 is _________.
 ● The predecessor of the smallest 5 digit number is _________.
1.2 Formation of large numbers
Now, we learn the formation of large numbers. Let us build and complete the number 
tower by observing the pattern of numbers.

Crores
We can observe that in every row the smallest number column has an additional zero 
compared to the previous row. You have read in lower classes about place value system. 
In this system (which was invented in India and spread to other countries!), the number 
10 plays a very important role. It is shown in the following table.
1 × 10 = 10 (Ten)
10 × 10 = 100 (Hundred)
100 × 10 = 1000 (Thousand)
1000 × 10 = 10000 (Ten Thousand)
10000 × 10 = 100000 (Lakhs)
100000 × 10 = 1000000 (Ten Lakhs)
1000000 × 10 = 10000000 (Crore)
While each new row gives a number 10 times bigger, what happens if we skip and go  
2 rows below. Numbers would be 100 times bigger. 
For example, 1000 = 100 times 10, or Thousand has “hundred tens” in it.
1.3 1.4 Place Value Chart
1.4.1 Indian Method
NOTE
As the numbers get large, it is difficult to keep track of the number of digits and the place 
value for each digit. Wherever possible, we use names like lakh and crore instead of writing 
so many zeros. However, we can write exact values of large numbers too, if needed.
1. Give 3 e xamples where the number of things counted by you would be a 5 digit 
number or more.
2. There are ten lakh people in a district. What would be the population of 10 such districts?
3. The Government spends rupees 2 crores for education in a particular district every 
month. What would be its expenditure over 10 months?

When we write large numbers we make use of place value chart to ensure that we do not 
miss any digit in between, while writing it. In a given number, starting from the right, the 
first three places make the ones period, the next two places make the thousands period, the 
next two places make the lakhs period and the next places make the crores period.
Try to  read  the  number  359468421.  Is  it  difficult?  Yes. It  is  not  easy. But  by  using  the 
indicators or the periods, it is easy to read and write 359468421 as under.

Use of comma
In any given number, we separate the periods by using commas. In our Indian System of Numeration, 
we use commas from the right. The first comma comes before Hundreds place (3 digits from the right). 
The second comma comes before Ten Thousands place (5 digits from the right). The third comma 
comes before Ten Lakhs place (7 digits from the right) and the digits next to it represents crore.

1.3.4 Place Value of digits in Large Numbers
Every digit of a number has a place value which gives the value of the digit. 
Write the number 676097 in expanded form:
   Number  : 6,76,097
   Expanded form : 6 lakhs + 7 ten thousands + 6 thousands + 0 hundreds + 9 tens + 7 ones
: 6 × 100000 + 7 × 10000 + 6 × 1000 + 0 × 100 + 9 × 10 + 7 × 1
: 600000 + 70000 + 6000 + 90 + 7
Finding the place value of all the digits in 9847056:
The Place value of 6 is = 6 Ones = 6 × 1 = 6
The Place value of 5 is = 5 Tens = 5 × 10 = 50
The Place value of 0 is = 0 Hundreds = 0 × 100 = 0
The Place value of 7 is = 7 Thousands = 7 × 1000 = 7,000
The Place value of 4 is = 4 Ten Thousands = 4 × 10000 =  40,000
The Place value of 8 is = 8 Lakhs = 8 × 100000 = 8,00,000
The Place value of 9 is = 9 Ten Lakhs = 9 × 1000000 = 90,00,000
Hence, the number 98,47,056 is read as Ninety Eight Lakh Forty Seven Thousand Fifty Six.

1.4 Comparison of Numbers
We are  familiar  with  the  concept  of  comparing  numbers  and  finding  the  biggest  among 
them. We use symbols <, > and = to compare any two numbers.
1.4.1 Comparing numbers with unequal number of digits
1.  When we compare the numbers 16090 
and 100616, we have already learnt that 
the number with more digits is greater.
 Hence, 1,00,616 (6 digit number) > 
16,090 (5 digit number).
2. Suppose we are given more than two numbers say 1468, 5, 201, 69 and 70000. Then 
among these, we can immediately say that the number 70000 is the greatest and 5 is 
the least, based on the number of digits.
1.4.2 Comparing numbers with equal number of digits
Think about the situation
In a distance analysis chart, the distance between Chennai and New Delhi is 2180 k.m. 
and Chennai to Noida is 2158 k.m. respectively. Which city is farther from Chennai?
Step 1 Step 2 Step 3
Compare the thousands 
place of two numbers
2   1  8  0
2   1  5  8
Here digit at the 
thousands place of both 
numbers are the same. 
We can’t arrive at any 
conclusion. So, we move 
on to the next step.
Compare the hundreds 
place of two numbers
2  1  8  0
2  1  5  8
Here digit at the 
hundreds place of both 
numbers are the same. 
We can’t arrive at any 
conclusion. So, we move 
on to the next step.
Compare the tens place 
of two numbers
2  1  8  0
2  1  5  8
Here digit at the tens 
place of both numbers 
are different, So, 
the number with the 
greatest tenth place 
will be the greater. 
Therefore,
2180 > 2158
Think!
Why we 
need not 
compare 
the one’s 
place?
Compare the given numbers 2180 and 2158 using the above mentioned steps.
2 = 2 1 = 1 8 > 5
 Hence, 2180 > 2158. So, New Delhi is farther from chennai.
1.  Write the numbers in the ascending 
order: 688, 9, 23005, 50, 7500.
2.  Find the least and the greatest among the 
numbers: 478, 98, 6348, 3, 6007, 50935.

Numbers
Example 1.5
Compare 59283746 and 59283748 using place value chart. 
Solution
Step 1: Number of digits in the two given numbers are equal.
Step 2: Compare the place values using the place value chart.
Place Value C T L L T Th Th H T O
First Number 5 9 2 8 3 7 4 6
Second Number 5 9 2 8 3 7 4 8
Compare the digits of the two numbers from the highest place value as noted below.
5 = 5 9 = 9 2 = 2 8 = 8 3 = 3 7 = 7 4 = 4 6 < 8
Here only the digits in the ones place are not equal and 6 < 8. 
Hence, 59283746 < 59283748.
1.4.3 Arranging the numbers in ascending and descending order
The  heights  of  five  different 
apartments named as A, B, C, D 
and E in a locality are 985 feet, 
1245 feet, 1865 feet, 355 feet 
and 585 feet respectively. They 
are shown according to their 
heights as shown in Fig. 1.1.
Can you arrange them in the 
ascending order of their heights?
Yes, We can arrange the numbers

Step 1
Compare the 4 digit numbers 1245 and 
1865. By following the steps mentioned 
for comparing the numbers having same 
number of digits, we get 1865 > 1245. 
The tallest apartment is ‘C’ (1865 feet).
The  next  tallest  apartment  is  ‘B’ 
(1245 feet).
Step 2
Compare the three digit numbers 985, 585 and 355. Using the above table, we get, 
985 > 585 > 355. The smallest among them is 355.
 Hence we write the heights of the apartments in ascending order as,
 355  < 585  < 985  <  1245  <   1865

Impact of Place Value
Consider the 4-digit number 3795. When we exchange the digits of two places, the number 
either becomes larger or smaller. For example, the given number is 3795. If the digits 9 
and 5 are exchanged, then the number is 3759. This number is less than the given number.
It makes a great impact in the situations like handling currencies.

1.6 Use of Large Numbers in Daily Life Situations
We know to apply four basic operations on numbers. We will see a few more examples 
which deal with the four operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
Example 1.6
In an exhibition,  the number of tickets sold on the first, second, third and fourth days are 
1,10,000, 75,060, 25,700 and 30,606 respectively. Find the total number of tickets sold 
on all the 4 days.

Numbers
Solution
  Number of tickets sold on the first day  =  1,10,000
 Number of tickets sold on the second day  =  75,060
 Number of tickets sold on the third day  =  25,700
 Number of tickets sold on the fourth day  =  30,606 
 Adding all the above, the total number of  
 tickets sold on all the 4 days =    2,41,366
Example 1.7
In  a  year , a  whole-sale  paper  firm  sold  6,25,600  notebooks  out  of  7,50,000  notebooks. 
Find the number of notebooks left unsold.
Solution
  Number of notebooks in the store  =  7,50,000
  Number of notebooks sold =  6,25,600
  Number of notebooks unsold  =  1,24,400
Example 1.8
In a mobile store, the number of mobiles sold during a month is 1250. Assuming that the 
same number of mobiles are sold every month, find the number of mobiles sold in 2 years.
Solution
Number of mobiles sold in 1 month =  1250
 1 year =  12 months
 2 years  =  2 × 12
  =  24 months
 Number of mobiles sold in 24 months  =  1250 × 24 = 30,000
Number of mobiles sold in 2 years  =  30,000
Example 1.9
If `10,00,000 was distributed in a Government scheme to 500 women in the Self Help 
Groups, then find the amount given  to each woman. 
Solution
 Amount to be given to 500 women =  `10,00,000
 Amount given to each woman  =  10,00,000 ÷ 500 = `2000
 Each woman in the Self Help Group was given `2000.

1.7 Order of Operations 
Think about the situation
Valli and her four friends went to a butter milk shop. Each had a cup of butter milk and paid  
`30, assuming that the cost of one cup of butter milk to be `6. But the shop keeper told that 
the cost of butter milk had increased by `2. Then, Valli decided to give `2 more and paid  
`32. But the shop keeper claimed that she had to pay `40. Who is correct? 
Valli calculated as,
= (5 × 6) + 2
= 30 + 2
= 32
Shop keeper 
calculated as,
= 5 × (6 + 2)
= 5 × 8
= 40
The amount `40 claimed by the Shop keeper is correct. This 
confusion can be avoided by using the brackets in the correct 
places like 5 × (6 + 2). 
The rule of order of operations is called as BIDMAS. In BIDMAS the operations done from 
left to right.
Expansion of BIDMAS
B Bracket ( )
I Indices (you will learn it later)
D Division ÷ or /
M Multiplication × 
A Addition  + 
S Subtraction −
  Now, we try to solve 9 + 5 × 2 by using BIDMAS, 
    9 + (5 × 2)  = 9 + 10 
      = 19
Example 1.10
 Simplify : 24 + 2 × 8 ÷ 2 – 1
Solution
      24 + 2 × 8 ÷ 2 − 1     (given question)
      = 24 + 2 × 4 − 1      ( ÷ operation, completed first)
      = 24 + 8 − 1        ( × operation, completed second)
      = 32 − 1        ( + operation, completed third)
      = 31          (− operation , completed  last)

1.8 Estimation of numbers
Let us see few examples now,
(ix) Nearly 60,000 people watched the Republic day parade at 
Rajpath, New Delhi.
(x) About 2,80,000 people of various countries died due to 
earthquake and Tsunami on 26th December 2004 in the 
Indian ocean.
(xi) The India-Pakistan cricket match was viewed by about 30 
million cricket fans in the Television all over the world. 
We often come across statements like these in TV channels and dailies. Do these news items, 
give the exact numbers? No. The numbers mentioned are not accurate. They are only the 
approximate or closer values to the actual ones. This is the reason, why we generally use 
words like “about”, “nearly” and “approximately”. These numbers are only the estimation of 
the actual value. The word ‘about’ denotes the number not exactly, but a little more or less. 
This value is called the estimated value. 
The actual figure, though not exactly possible, could have been 59,853 or 61,142 for the 
first example and it could have been 2,78,955 or 2,80,984 for the second example. Imagine 
and write about, what could have been the exact number for the third example given above? 
Similarly, there are many more possible numbers. Thus,
 ● to get a rough idea we need estimation.
 ● to get the estimated value, we generally round off the numbers to their nearest tens, 
hundreds or thousands.
Some real life situations where we use estimates are
(a) Cost of a Television, Refrigerator, Mixer Grinder etc., are usually expressed in 
thousands of rupees.
(b) The Voters population in an Assembly Constituency in a state is often stated in 
lakhs.
(c)  The Central or State Government’s Annual Budget is usually given in lakh crore.
When an exact answer is not necessary, estimation strategies can be used to determine 
a reasonably close answer.

1. Fill in the jar with some items like Tamarind seeds. Let each student give an estimate 
of the number of items. Make a table of the result by finding the difference of the 
estimate and the actual amount.
2. Get a large jar and a bag of Tamarind seeds and put 30 seeds in the jar. Observing 
the contents, estimate how many seeds roughly will fill the whole jar . Continue to fill 
the jar to check your estimate.
Rounding off is one way to find a number for estimation that is quite convenient. It gives us 
the closest suitable number according to a given place value. There are four steps involved 
in the rounding process. Let us illustrate this with an example.
Example 1.12
 Round off the number 8,436 to the nearest hundreds.
Step To do 8,436 to hundreds
Step 1 Find the digit in hundreds place 8,436
Step 2 Look at the digit to its right 8,436
Step 3 If this digit is 5 or greater, add 1 to it. If it is  
less than 5, leave it unchanged
8,436 (3 < 5)
Leave 4 unchanged
Step 4 Change the digits to the right of 4 to zeros 8,400

Step To do 78,794 to thousands
Step 1 Find the digit in thousands place 78,794
Step 2 Look at the digit to its right 78,794
Step 3 If this digit is 5 or greater, add 1 to it. If it 
is less than 5, leave it unchanged

Solution
Here, 188 is nearer to 200 and 31 is nearer to 30.
The exact cost of 31 copies is 188 × 31 = ` 5828 whereas, 
The estimated cost of 31 copies = 200 × 30  = ` 6000
Therefore, the estimated cost of 31 copies of Thirukkural books is ` 6000.

1.9 Whole Numbers 
What is Mathematics about? It is about numbers, perhaps about shapes as well. It is 
true that people usually count 1,2,3... on various situations. This collection of counting 
numbers  {1,2,3,...}  is  called  Natural  numbers,  denoted  by  N.  If  this  collection  includes 
0 as well, then the collection  {0,1,2,3,...} is called Whole numebrs, denoted by W .
1.9.1 Recall the facts on Natural and Whole Numbers  
• The smallest natural number is 1.
• The smallest whole number is 0.
• Every number has a successor. The number that comes just after the given number  
 is its successor.
• Every number has a predecessor. The number 1 has a predecessor in W namely ‘0’,  
 but it has no predecessor in N. The number ‘0’ has no predecessor in W.
•  There is an order to numbers. By comparing the two given numbers the larger of the  
  two can be identified.
•  Numbers  are  endless.  By  adding  1  to  any  chosen  large  number , the  next  number 
 can be found.
Logical and Mathematical operations of numbers are used in everyday arithmetic of 
numbers. These operations can be made easier using properties. Certain properties of 
numbers are already used without actually knowing them. For example, while adding

1.10  Properties of Whole Numbers 
The properties of numbers are important facts to be remembered,which helps to do 
arithmetic calculations more precisely and to avoid mistakes.  
1.10.1 Commutativity of addition and multiplication
When two numbers are added (or multiplied), the order of the numbers does not affect 
the sum (or the product). This is called commutativity of addition (or multiplication).
Observe the given facts:
 (i)   43 + 57   =  57 + 43
 (ii)  12 × 15   =  15 × 12 
 (iii) 35,784 + 48,12,69,841   =  48,12,69,841 + 35,784
 (iv) 39,458 × 84,321   =  84,321 × 39,458
Such facts are called as equations. In each of the above equations, the answers on both 
the sides are same. Finding the answer for the third and fourth equations takes more 
time.  But,  these  equations  are  meant  to  convey  the  properties  of  numbers.  The  third 
equation is correct by commutativity of addition and the fourth equation is correct by 
commutativity of multiplication.
There is a nice pictorial way of understanding commutativity of multiplication. If we 
have 5 rows of stars, each with 4 stars, we can draw the total of 20 stars as a rectangle  
(5 × 4 = 20). See Fig.1.2 below. Now rotate the rectangle given in Fig.1.2 (a) to get the 
Fig.1.2(c) as given below. It is the same rectangle. It has exactly the same total number 
of stars,  20. But now we have 4 rows of stars,  each with 5 stars!  That is, 5 × 4 = 4 × 5.

Fig. 1.2
Now, look at the following example. 
7  –  3 = 4  but  3  –  7 will not give the same answer. Similarly, the answers of 12 ÷ 6 
and 6 ÷ 12 are not equal.
That is, 7  –  3 ≠ 3  –  7 and 12 ÷ 6 ≠ 6 ÷ 12
Hence, In whole numbers subtraction and division are not commutative.
TRY THESE
 ● Use atleast three different pairs of whole numbers to verify that subtraction is not 
commutative.
 ● Is 10  ÷  5, the same as 5 ÷ 10? Justify it by taking two more combinations  
of numbers.
1.10.2 Associativity of addition and multiplication
When several numbers are added, the order in which the numbers are added does not 
matter. This is called associativity of addition. Similarly, when several numbers are to be 
multiplied, the order in which the numbers are multiplied does not matter. This is called 
associativity of multiplication.
It can be said that the following equations are correct, without actually doing any addition 
or multiplication, but by using the property of associativity. A few examples are given 
below:
6th_Maths_EM_Term1_Chapter 1.indd   24 19/11/2022   15:35:45
25
Numbers
 (43 + 57) + 25  =  43 + (57 + 25)
 12 × (15 × 7)  =  (12 × 15) × 7
 35,784 + (48,12,69,841 + 3)  =  (35,784 + 48,12,69,841) + 3
 (39,458 × 84,321) × 17 =  39,458 × (84,321 × 17) 
It is to be noted that here too, subtraction and division are not associative.
1.10.3  Distributivity of multiplication over addition or subtraction
An interesting fact relating to addition and multiplication comes from the following patterns:
 (72 × 13) + (28 × 13)  =  (72 + 28) × 13 
 37 × 102  =  (37 × 100) + (37 × 2) 
 37 × 98  =  (37 × 100)  –  (37 × 2)
From the last two cases, we are arriving at the following equations:
 37 × (100 + 2)  =  (37 × 100) + (37 × 2) 
   37 × (100 − 2)   =   (37 × 100)  –  (37 × 2)
It can be noted that the product of a number and a sum of numbers can be written as the 
sum of two products. Similarly, the product of a number and a number got by subtraction 
can be written as the difference of two products. This property is called the property of 
distributivity of multiplication over addition or subtraction. It is a very useful property to 
group numbers in a convenient way. Now let us say 18 × 6 = (10 + 8) × 6 in an easy way 
as shown in Fig.1.3.
18 8
6 =  + 6 6
10
  (a) (b) (c)Fig.1.3
Thus, 18 × 6 = (10 + 8) × 6  is shown clearly in the above figure.
It is to be noted that addition does not distribute over multiplication.
For example,
10 + (10 × 5) = 60 and  (10 + 10) × (10 + 5) = 300 are not equal.
1.10.4  Identity for addition and multiplication
When zero is added to any number, we get the same number. Similarly, when we multiply 
any number by 1, we get the same number. So, zero is called the additive identity and one 
is called the multiplicative identity for whole numbers.

Finally, these are some simple observations that are important.
 ● When we add any two natural numbers, we get a natural number. Similarly when we 
multiply any two natural numbers, we get a natural number.
 ● When we add any two whole numbers, we get a whole number. Similarly when we 
multiply any two whole numbers, we get a whole number.
 ● When we add a natural number to a whole number, we get a natural number. When 
we multiply a natural number by a whole number, we get a whole number.

2.2 Patterns
Mathematics is easy when we look at it as a study of patterns. Patterns allow us to make 
reasonable guesses. Understanding patterns provide a clear basis for problem solving 
skills. In this chapter, we are going to look at patterns that deals with numbers. For 
example, let us list the numbers we know in order 
     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 
We observe that 1 is odd, 2 is even, 3 is odd, 4 is even etc. Thus odd numbers and even 
numbers alternate with each other. If these is a sequence 12, 8, 4 … can you find the 
next number? Easy, each number is obtained by subtracting 4 from the previous number.  
So the fourth number is 0. 
The branch of Mathematics that deals with such patterns is called Algebra. Today Algebra is 
used widely in many fields that include banking, insurance, accounting, statistics, science, 
engineering, manufacturing and so on.

2.2.1 Patterns in Number Operations
In the first chapter on Whole Numbers, you have learnt about numbers that are multiplied 
by 1 or 0.  
For example, we know, 57 × 1 = 57 and 43 × 0 = 0.
But we also know that this statement is true for all numbers (not just for the above two).  
So, can we say “any number” × 1 = "the same number" that we started with?
Algebra gives a way for writing such facts in a short and sweet way. We can write the 
above statement as n × 1 = n, where n is a number. Here n on the left-hand side is just 
a letter that is used instead of saying " any number". The number on the right-hand side 
is the same n. This ensures that we get a correct statement! 
In Algebra, we say that “n” is a variable. A variable is a symbol (usually an alphabet like 
n or x) that represents a number. Variables often help us to write briefly what we mean 
by a relation. In n × 1 = n, left side number quantity 1 do not vary always. So we call it 
as constant.

Introduction to Algebra
For example, the following patterns such as,
 7 + 9   =   9 + 7
 57 + 43   =   43 + 57
 123 + 456   =   456 + 123
 7098 + 2018   =   2018 + 7098
 35784 + 481269841   =   481269841 + 35784
can be simply summarized as  a + b = b + a.
Here, we have two variables namely “a” and “b”. Each variable can take “any value” , 
but the value of ‘a’ is the same on both sides, and the value of ‘b’ is also the same on 
both sides. But, the values of ‘a’ and ‘b’ need not be equal  to each other.
Can you give a similar intrepretation for  a × b = b × a ?
NOTE
Similar rules cannot be written for subtraction! We know what is ‘7 − 3’, but not ‘3 − 7’. 
So ‘a − b’ and ‘b − a’ are not the same!
2.3 Understanding operations on Variables
Consider the following situations.
Situation 1:
Mathi is 3 years elder than his sister Nila. If we know Nila's age, 
can we find Mathi’s?
If Nila’s age is ‘n’, you can see that Mathi’s age is always  
‘n + 3’. This is the advantage of using variables. We do not need 
different statements for different values of the age! As we give 
different values for ‘n’, we get different values for ‘n + 3’, here 
3 is a constant. This is clear from the following table. 
Nila's age 'n' Mathi’s age 'n + 3'
If n = 4 7
If n = 8 11
If n = 12 15

Situation 2:
Patterns using Ice Candy Sticks
Pari and Manimegalai made some patterns with ice candy sticks.
To make one ‘T’, how many ice candy sticks are used by them?  (Two sticks)
To make two ‘T’s, how many ice candy sticks are used by them? (Four sticks)
Continuing this, they prepared the following table to find the number of ice candy sticks 
used by them
Number of ‘T’s formed 1 2 3 4 .  .   .  k .  .   .   
Number of ice candy 
sticks used / required
2 4 6 8 .  .   .  2k .  .   .   
1 × 2 2 × 2 3 × 2 4 × 2 .  .   .  k × 2 .  .   .   
From the above table, it is clear that if the number of ‘T’s required by them is ‘k’ then the 
number of ice candy sticks required by them will be   k × 2 = 2k. Here ‘k’ is a variable.
2.4 Framing Algebraic Statements
Consider that there are ‘n’ number of apples in a basket. If 5 more apples are 
added, what will be the total number of apples in the basket now? 
The total number of apples can be easily framed into an algebraic statement 
as ‘n + 5’. This algebraic statement ‘n + 5’ tells that, whatever be the number of apples 
you had earlier, there are 5 more apples now in the basket.
 ● Suppose there are unknown number of people in a bus, say ‘x’ and if 2 more people 
get into the bus, then there will be ‘x + 2’ people in the bus. 
TRY THESE
Use a variable to write the rule, which gives the number of ice candy sticks required 
to make the following patterns. 
(i) a pattern of letter C as   (ii) a pattern of letter M as

 ● There is a patty of butter which weighs ‘w’ grams. If you cut off 100 grams from it, 
you will have ‘w − 100’ grams left. 
 ● If you start with a number ‘y’ and then double it, you can write it as ‘2y’ (you know, 
‘2y’ means 2 multiplied by y).

This can be written as, x – 6 gives 10, where ‘x’ denotes the unknown number.  
Now, we will find out for what value of ‘x’, x − 6 gives 10.
Value of ‘x’ 
Yes/No x − 6 Result Is it 10?
7 7 − 6 1 No
10 10 − 6 4 No
12 12 − 6 6 No
15 15 − 6 9 No
16 16 − 6 10 Yes
18 18 − 6 12 No
Hence, the unknown number (variable) ‘x’ takes the value 16.  
Example 2.2
Athiyan and Mugilan are brothers. Athiyan is ‘p’ years old and Mugilan is elder to Athiyan 
by 6 years. Write an algebraic statement for this and find the age of Mugilan if Athiyan is  
20 years old.
 Age of Athiyan  =   ‘p’ years
 Age of Mugilan  =  ‘p + 6’ years (algebraic statement)
 If p = 20, then Mugilan’s age is   =   20 + 6
   =   26 years.

Ratio and proportion
3.1 Introduction
In our daily life, we handle lots of situations where we compare quantities. Comparison 
of our heights, weights, marks secured in examinations, speeds of vehicles, distances 
travelled, auto fare to taxi fare, bank balances at different periods of time and many more 
things are done.  Comparison is usually between quantities of the same kind and not of 
different kind. It will not be meaningful to compare the height of a person with the age of 
another person. Also, we need a standard measure for comparison.
This  sort of comparison by expressing one quantity as the number of times the other is 
called a ‘Ratio’.

Think about this Situation
Let us consider a situation of cooking 
rice for two persons. The quantity of rice 
required for two persons is one cup. To 
cook every one cup of rice, we need to 
add two cups of water. Assuming that 8 
more guests join for lunch, will the use of 
ratio help us in handing this situation?
The number of cups of rice and water 
required are given below.

 Mathematics
It is possible to trace the origin of the  
word "ratio" to the Ancient Greek 
Medieval. Writers used the word proprotio 
("proportion") to indicate ratio and 
proportionalities ("proprotionality") for 
the equality of ratios. Early translators 
rendered this into Latin as ratio ("reason"; 
as in the word "rational")

Number of cups of rice 1 2 3 4 5
Number of cups of water 
(or) No. of persons 2 4 6 8 10
In all the cases, the number of cups of water (or) the number of persons is 2 times the 
number of cups of rice. So, we write
Number of cups of rice : Number of cups of water (or) the number of persons = 1 : 2
Such comparison is called as a Ratio.
NOTE
 ● A ratio is a comparison of two quantities with same units.
 ● If ‘a’ and ‘b’ are two different quantities with same unit then, we can write the 
ratio as a:b (read as a is to b).
 ● A ratio can be written as a fraction; ratios are mostly written in the simplest form.
 ● In the above example, the ratio of rice to water in terms of the number of cups 
can be written in three different ways as 1 : 2 or 2
1  or 1 to 2 .

3.2.1  Properties of Ratio
 ● A ratio has no unit. It is a number.  For example, the ratio of 8 km to 4 km is written 
as 8 : 4 = 2 : 1 and not 2 km : 1 km
 ● The two quantities in a ratio should be of the same unit. The ratio of 4 km to  
400 m is expressed as (4 × 1000) : 400 = 4000 : 400 = 10 : 1

Ratio and proportion
 ● Each number of the ratio is called a term.
 ● Order of the terms in a ratio cannot be reversed.
A few examples are given below.
(a)
 (b)
Ratio of the number of small fish to the 
number of big fish is 5 : 1
Ratio of the number of boys to girls in 
above figure is 5 : 4
In the above example, the ratio of the number of small fish to the number of big fish is 5 : 1. 
The same information cannot be written as 1 : 5 and so, 5 : 1 and 1 : 5 are not the same. 
If in a class, there are 12 boys and 12 girls, then the ratio of number of boys to the number 
of girls is expressed as 12 : 12 which is the same as 1 : 1.

3.2.5  Equivalent Ratios
We can get equivalent ratios by multiplying or dividing the numerator and denominator by 
a common number. This is clear from the following example. Let us find the ratio between 
breadth and length of the following rectangles given below.
2 cm
1 cm
4 cm
2 cm
8 cm
4 cm
A
B
C
 ● Ratio of breadth to length of rectangle A is 1 : 2 (already in simplest form)
 ● Ratio of breadth to length of rectangle B is 2 : 4 (simplest form is 1 : 2)
 ● Ratio of breadth to length of rectangle C is 4 : 8 (simplest form is 1 : 2)
 ● Thus, the ratios of breadth and length of rectangles A, B and C are said to be 
equivalent ratios.
 ● That is, the ratios 1 : 2 = 2 : 4 = 4 : 8 are equivalent.

Situation 2
Let us consider another situation. For example, if a thread of 5 m is cut at 3 m, then the 
length of two pieces are 3 m and 2 m and the ratio of the two pieces is 3 : 2. From this 
we say that, a ratio ‘a : b’ is said to have a total of ‘a+b’ parts in it.
Example 3.5
Kumaran has ` 600 and wants to divide it between Vimala and Yazhini in the ratio 2 : 3. 
Who will get more and how much?
Solution
 Divide the whole money into 2 + 3 = 5 equal parts then, Vimala gets 2 parts out of 5 
parts and Yazhini gets 3 parts out of 5 parts. 
 Amount Vimala gets = ` 600 × 5
2  = ` 240 
 Amount Yazhini  gets = ` 600 × 5
3  = ` 360  
 Vimala received ` 240 and Yazhini gets ` 360,  
which is ` 120 more than that of Vimala.

3.3 Proportion 
When two ratios are equal , we say that the ratios are in  Proportion.This is 
denoted as a : b : :  c : d and it is read as ‘a is to b as c is to d’. The following situations 
explain about proportion.
Situation 1
 The Teacher said to the students, “You can do a maximum of 4 projects in Mathematics.  
You will get 5 as internal marks for each project that you do”. Kamala asked, “Teacher, 
What if I do 2 or 3 or 4 projects?” The teacher replied, “For 2 projects you will get 10 
marks, for 3 projects you will get 15 marks and for 4 projects you will get 20 marks”.
6th_Maths_EM_Term1_Chapter 3.indd   55 28/11/2022   17:14:07
56
6th Standard Mathematics
 Here “1 project carries 5 marks” is equivalent to saying “2 projects carry 10 marks” 
and so on and hence the ratios, 1 : 5 = 2 : 10 = 3 : 15 = 4 : 20 are said to be in 
Proportion. Thus 1 : 5 is in proportion to 2 : 10, 3 : 15, 4 : 20 and so on. This is denoted by  
1 : 5 : :  2 : 10 and it is read as ‘1 is to 5 as 2 is to 10’ and so on.
Situation 2
The size of the photograph of Srinivasa Ramanujan as shown in Figure 3.3 (a) is of length 
5 grids and breadth 3 grids. Figure 3.3 (b) shows the enlarged size of the photograph of 
length 10 grids and breadth 6 grids. Here,

As the two ratios are equal, the given figures are in  proportion. This is  represented as  
5 : 10 : :  3 : 6 or 5 : 10 = 3 : 6 and it is read as ‘5 is to 10 as 3 is to 6’
3.3.1  Proportionality law
If two ratios are in proportion ie., a : b : :  c : d then the product of the extremes is equal to 
the product of the means ad=bc. This is called the proportionality law. Here, a and d are the 
extremes and b and c are the means. Also, if two ratios are equal ie., ad = bc is 
called the cross product of proportions.

Ratio and proportion
Example 3.6
By proportionality law, check whether 3 : 2  and  30 : 20 are in proportion.
Solution
Here the extremes are 3 and 20 and the means are 2 and 30.
Product of extremes, ad = 3 × 20 = 60.
Product of means, bc = 2 × 30 = 60.
Thus by proportionality law, we find ad = bc and hence 3 : 2  and  30 : 20 are in proportion.
Example 3.7
A picture is resized in a computer as shown below.
Do you observe any change in shape and size of the picture? Check whether the ratios 
formed by its length and breadth are in proportion by cross product method. 
Solution
The given pictures are in the ratio 2 : 5 and 4 : 3 respectively.
Here the extremes are 2 and 3 and the means are 5 and 4.
Product of extremes, ad = 2 × 3 = 6.
Product of means, bc = 5 × 4 = 20.
Thus, we find ad ! bc and hence 2 : 5 and  4 : 3 are not in proportion.
3.4 Unitary Method
Finding the value of one unit and then using it to find the value of the required number of 
units is known as unitary method.
Steps involved in Unitary Method
 ● Express the given problem in Mathematical statement.
 ● Find the value of one unit of the given item using division.

Example 3.8
Pari wants to buy 5 tennis balls from a sports shop. If a dozen balls cost ` 180, how much 
should Pari pay to buy 5 balls?
Solution
By unitary method, we can solve this as follows : 
Cost of a dozen balls = `180 
Cost of 12 balls  = `180
Cost of 1 ball   = 12
180  = `15
Cost of 5 balls   = 5 x 15 = `75
Hence, Pari has to pay `75 for 5 balls. 
Example 3.9
A heater uses 3 units of electricity in 40 minutes. How many units does it consume in 2 hours?
Solution
In 40 minutes, electricity used    = 3 units.
In 1 minute, electricity used    = 40
3  units.
In 120 minutes (2 hours), electricity used = 40
3 120#  = 9 units
Thus, the heater consumed 9 units of electricity in 2 hours.

 ● Ratios are often expressed as fractions in the simplest form.
 ● A ratio has no unit.
 ● The two quantities of a ratio should be in the same unit.
 ● Order of the terms in a ratio cannot be reversed.
 ● To get an equivalent ratio, multiply or divide the numerator and denominator by 
the same number.
 ● When two ratios are equal, they are said to be in proportion.
 ● The proportionality law states that the product of the extremes is equal to the 
product of the means.
 ● Finding the value of required number of units by knowing the value of one unit is 
known as unitary method.

4.1 Introduction
Geometry means the measurement of the earth. It includes the study of the properties of 
shapes and its measures. In ancient days, geometry was developed for the practical purpose 
of construction, surveying and various crafts.
Nature evolves out of simple geometrical shapes and patterns from tiny atoms to huge galaxies. 
The objects that you see in your environment have an impact of geometrical ideas. An appealing 
appearance of houses and buildings are made possible by geometrical thinking. Vehicles like 
cycle, car, bus are designed using geometrical concepts. The toys that you play with, the tools 
like pencil, scale and book that you use with, give rise to geometrical ideas and shapes.
In this chapter, we will learn about the geometrical concepts such as lines, line segments, 
rays and angles.

4.1.1  Fun with lines
What shapes can you draw with 3 lines or 4 lines or 5 lines? 
We have already seen some shapes with names like triangles,  rectangles and squares.
 
Fig. 4.1
Here is a shape which is  in the form of a fish (see Fig. 4.1). 
It has 5 lines.  Can you draw a fish with 4 lines or with 3 lines?  Think!
4.1.2  Only two lines
What shapes can you draw with only TWO lines?
The following forms are possible with 2 lines.  Isn’t it?
Fig. 4.2
Is there something you notice in all these shapes?
4.1.3  Only one line
What shapes can be drawn with only ONE line?  The line may be standing 
upright, lying flat, or slanting. Perhaps it can be, slant left or slant right. It may 
be long or short. 
Now, consider the following situation.
The teacher gives Yazhini a paper with a 
line drawn on it and asks Akilan to draw the 
same line on the black board, as instructed 
by Yazhini.  Then they shall reverse the process. They 
do the same with other shapes using 2 lines and 3 lines.  
Try doing this and say, whether this is easy to do!
Observe the following conversation.
Teacher  : Sakthi, can you say how to draw lines?  
Sakthi  : Yes Teacher! Why only lines? I may like to 
draw curves and circles too! 
6th_Maths_EM_Term1_Chapter 4.indd   64 19/11/2022   17:26:02

Geometry
Teacher :  Sakthi, you can do all the shapes you like.  But you see, there is enough 
difficulty in describing shapes made only of lines.  So, we will get to curves and 
circles later.   
Sakthi :  Teacher, Why should we describe shapes?  We can just draw and show them 
when we want.  
  Is Sakthi right? 
In Mathematics, every thinking is interesting and unlimited. Remember numbers;  
it is not stopped with adding 2 – digits. Numbers go on endlessly and it is possible 
to add any two numbers, however large. We know that even a 37- digit number 
ending in 0 is divisible by 5.
It is the same with shapes too.  We are interested in lines, triangles, rectangles 
and in whatever the shapes may be and the size however large or small.  We need to give 
them names not only to describe them but also to explore a lot with them.
4.2 Describing lines
A line can be long or short. A line can be flat or slant or vertical. If a line is rotated in any 
direction, it remains to be a line. So, given below (Fig. 4.3) are lines in different positions.
Fig. 4.3
But the following (Fig.4.4) are not straight lines.
Fig. 4.4
If the length of a line is ignored, then it can be extended in both the directions without 
ending as in (Fig. 4.5) given below. A line through two points A and B is written as  AB or 
BA . Also it is denoted by a letter ‘ l ’.

4.2.1  Line segment
What do we call a line that is short and ends on both sides?  That we call it as a line 
segment and name both of its ends with letters as shown in fig. 4.6.
A B
P Q
C
D
Fig. 4.6
We usually use CAPITAL LETTERS to denote the ends of 
the line segments. A line segment is denoted by AB  . 
What can we do with a line segment?  We can measure 
its length. Given two line segments, we can compare their 
lengths and say which is shorter and which is longer .
Even if we measure length as a number , we get lots of line 
segments, each with a definite length. Using a ruler, we 
can draw the following line segments. 
1 cm  A  B
2 cm  A  B
3 cm  A   B
...
10 cm  A   B
What about a line segment of length 17 cm or 20 cm or 30 cm or 378 cm? Like, numbers 
never end, line segments get longer and longer forever!

Geometry originated from two Greek words, geo, meaning earth and metron 
meaning measure. Geometry means earth measure. Around 600 B.C.(BCE), 
Thales of Miletus was the first to use deductive methods to develop geometric concepts. 
The Greek Mathematician, Pythagoras continued the systematic development of 
Geometry. 
Example  4.1
With the help of a ruler and compass, draw a line segment PQ = 5.5cm.
Solution
 ● Draw a line ‘ l ’  and mark a point ‘P’ on it as shown in Fig. 4.10.
P
l
 ● Measure 5.5 cm 
using compass as 
shown in Fig. 4.11 
placing the pointer 
at ‘0’ and the pencil 
pointer at 5.5 cm.
 ● Place the pointer of 
the compass at ‘ P ’ 
then draw a small arc 
on the line ‘ l ’ with 
the pencil pointer 
(Fig. 4.12).  It cuts 
the line ‘ l ’ at a point 
and name that point 
as ‘Q’ (Fig. 4.13).
 ● Now, PQ is the required line segment of length 5.5 cm.

ACTIVITY
This game can be played in small groups. Take 10 or more sticks 
of equal length. Join them as a bundle and put them on the floor 
in such a way that they fall one above the other. The challenge 
is to take one stick after other without disturbing the position of 
the other sticks.

4.2.3  Two lines
Now let us get back to two lines (Fig. 4.14). Lines that go on forever on either side without 
meeting each other (i.e. they have a constant distance in between) are called parallel lines. 
l1
 l2
Fig. 4.14
Thus, parallel lines go forever without meeting.
What will happen if two lines are not parallel?
Then they must meet somewhere! Of course, they go their way after meeting too.

Here, l1 and l2 are called intersecting lines.  
Of course, we now have parallel line segments and intersecting line segments too.

How would you describe whether a ray (or line segment) is vertical or slanting with respect 
to another ray (or line segment)?
Carrom board involves many geometric concepts like line 
segments and angles. When the striker hits the coin, the coin 
moves in a straight line . When the striker or coins hit the 
board end they make angles with the board while returning.
When two rays or line segments meet at their end points, they form an angle at that point.

Each of the angles in the above Fig. 4.27 is greater than right angle. If an angle is more 
than 90° and less than 180° is called an  obtuse angle.
Stand facing the north side. Take a ‘right angle turn’ clockwise; you now face east. Again 
take another ‘right angle turn’ in the same direction. You now face south. Once again take 
another ‘right angle turn’ in the same direction. You now face west. Then follow the same 
you will come to the original position. Thus the complete turn is called one revolution. The 
turn from north to south will be two right angles. It is also called a straight angle.  Two 
straight angles make one complete revolution. This is illustrated in the following figures.

4.3.4  Angle measurement using Protractor
How do we measure an angle? Using a PROTRACTOR we can measure an angle.
Outer Scale
Base LineCentreInner Scale
 
A protractor has one centre and a base line. It has two scales namely, inner scale from 
0° to 180° in anti clockwise direction and outer scale from 0° to 180° in the clockwise 
direction. Why does the protractor stop with 180°?  We can rotate the protractor and 
measure, so 180° is enough.
Steps To Measure an angle
Step 1:   Place the centre of the protractor on the vertex of the angle and line up the base 
line with 0°. 
Step 2:  Read the measure where the other ray crosses the protractor.

Summary
 ● A line extends along both directions without end.
 ● A line segment has two end points.
 ● Parallel lines never meet.
 ● When two lines meet they are called intersecting lines.
 ● When two rays have common starting point, they form an angle at that point.
 ● We measure angles using protractor.
 ● An angle whose measure is less than 90º is called an acute angle.
 ● An angle whose measure is exactly 90º is called a right angle.
 ● An angle whose measure is greater than 90º is called an obtuse angle.
 ● When the two rays or lines coincide, they are said to make angle zero, that is 0º.
 ● Two angles are complementary when they add up to 90º.
 ● Two angles are supplementary when they add up to 180º.
 ● Given any two points there is a unique line passing through them.
 ● When three points lie on a line, they are said to be collinear.
 ● When two lines meet each other at 90° at the point of intersection, they are called 
perpendicular lines.
 ● When three or more lines pass through the same point, they are said to be 
concurrent.  That point is called the Point of Concurrency.

5.1 Introduction
Think about this situation
The Headmaster of a school (see Fig. 5.1) wanted 
to open Saving Bank accounts for his students. For 
this, he needed data from his students. Students did 
not understand the meaning of the word ‘data’. Do 
you know what it means? Data means, "collection 
of information about anything". Data is collected, 
measured and analyzed, whereupon it can be visualized using graphs or images. In this 
case, the details could consist of information like the ration card number with address, 
the name of the student, Aadhaar card identity number, date of birth, phone number for 
communication etc., These are preserved for drawing inferences.

5.2 Data
In our daily life, we come across many 
situations where we need to collect information 
in the form of Facts or Numbers.
For example,
 ● Number of studen ts using calculators 
in your class.
 ● Number of brothers and sisters in 
your family.

 Mathematics
The word ‘data’ was first used 
in 1640’s.In 1946, the word ‘data’ also 
meant for “transmittable and storable 
computer information”. In 1954, a term 
called ‘data processing’ was introduced. 
The plural form of ‘datum’ is ‘data’. It 
also means “given” or “to give” in Latin.

 ● Number of different types of houses in a village.
 ● Number of girls wearing bangles.
 ● Number of buses crossing a certain road junction at a particular time. 
 ● Number of persons in a street who watch T.V. for more than 2 hours a day.
 ● Number of shops in a shopping mall selling textiles.
 ● Speeds of bikes, cars and other vehicles passed along a specific highway.
Thus, the numerical information or facts collected are known as Data .
5.2.1  Collection of data
Santhi collected the following information about her friend's preference of sweets which 
is as shown below.
Friend's name Sweet preferred Friend's name Sweet preferred
Vetri Gulabjamun Sadaiyan Laddu
Kurinji Laddu Rafiq Gulabjamun
Mullai Cake Francis Laddu

This way of collecting the data helps Santhi to decide, what sweets to get for her birthday 
and how much for each.

5.2.2  Types of Data
On the basis of collection, data are of two types. They are primary data and secondary data.
Primary data
Primary data means the raw data (not tailored data) which has 
just been collected from the original source and has not gone 
any kind of statistical treatment like sorting and tabulation.
Examples
 ● List of absentees in the class.
 ● A survey on writing habits of students conducted by a pen manufacturing company.
 ● The types of leaves collected by students for studying nature.
Secondary Data 
Secondary data consists of second hand information which has already been collected. It 
could have been collected by someone other than the user, for some other purpose.
Examples
 ● The Headmaster collects the students’ absentee 
list from school office.
 ● Cricket scores gathered from a website.
 ● Data from Television and Newspapers.
 ● List of contact numbers from telephone directory.
5.2.3  Organizing Data
The collected data are to be arranged methodically or logically so that the information can 
be looked up fast whenever needed, easily and efficiently. The method of organizing the 
data is discussed as follows.
Tally Marks
Consider the data collected by Santhi (given in Table). Is 
it easy to get the required information from the data? For 
example, can any one quickly tell the number of people who 
do not like Laddu?  No. So she decides to organize the data 
(See Fig. 5.2).  
Her friends come to help her. Malar arranges the data as 
given below in the table.  She uses ‘’ marks to note down 
how many friends like each of the sweets.  The count of each sweet is called as “Frequency”.
ACTIVITY
Collect data on the  level 
of literacy of people in 
your street.
Primary data is 
collected in person and 
so more reliable than 
Secondary data.

it does not 
matter 
whether you 
use  ‘’ or ‘|’.

 ● The occurrence of each information is marked by a vertical line ‘ |’.
 ● Every fifth tally is recorded by striking through the previous four vertical lines as ‘ ’.

5.3 Representation of data using Pictograph
The teacher was discussing about the pollution caused by the vehicles. The students said 
that they saw many vehicles when they were standing in the bus stop while coming to 
school. Everyone described in their own way, but Azhagi drew the pictures of the vehicles 
that she had seen, as shown below.
All the students were able to easily understand that Azhagi had seen 5 cars, 3 lorries and 
2 buses. This sort of representation of data using pictures is called Pictograph.
Nowadays pictographs are frequently used in promotion of tourism, weather forecast, 
geography etc.
Advantages of using Pictograph
● The data can be easily analyzed and interpreted.
● The pictures and symbols help us to understand better.
A pictograph is the 
representation of data 
through pictures.
NOTE
 ● The pictograph is a pictorial representation for a word or Phrase. 
 ● A pictograph is also called Pictogram.
 ● Pictographs were used as the earliest known form of writing examples having 
been discovered in Egypt and Mesopotomia since 3000 BC.

5.3.1  Need for scaling in the Pictograph
Fig. 5.3 shows,  a fruit stall where there are 40 mangoes, 
55 apples, 35 oranges and 60 bananas. How can we 
represent this data by using pictures? If the data is very 
large, it is very difficult and time consuming to represent 
each of the fruits in a pictograph. In such cases, we can 
use one picture to represent many of the same kind. 
This is called scaling . 
5.3.2  Drawing Pictographs
Consider the above data of fruits. 40 and 60 are multiples of 10, while 55 and 35 are 
multiples of 5. Let us assume, that One full picture of fruit represents 10 fruits and One 
half picture represents 5 fruits . 
The pictograph can be drawn for the above data as shown in the table.
5.3.3  Interpreting pictograph
From the above pictograph the number of fruits can be calculated very easily. 
Number of Mangoes  =  4 full pictures  4 × 10 = 40 mangoes
Number of Apples  =  5 full pictures and 1 half picture    
      (5 x 10) + 5 = 55 apples
Number of Bananas  =  6 full pictures  6 × 10 = 60  bananas
Number of Oranges  =  3 full pictures and 1 half picture   
      (3 x 10) + 5 = 35 oranges

Key: One picture represents 10 vehicles     
Look at the pictograph and answer the following questions.
(i) How many motor cycles were sold in a year?
(ii) Number of buses sold in a year is 20. Say True or False.
(iii) How many bicycles were sold ?
(iv) How many cars and vans were sold?
(v) How many vehicles were sold altogether?
Solution
Given : 1 picture represents 10 vehicles
(i) There were 9 × 10 = 90 motor cycles sold.
(ii) True.
(iii) There were 4 × 10 = 40 bicycles sold.
(iv) There were 7 cars and 3 vans pictures.  
Therefore  70 + 30 = 100  cars and vans sold. 
(v) There were 7 cars, 3 vans, 9 motor cycles, 2 buses and 4 bicycles sold.  
Therefore,  70 + 30 + 90 + 20 + 40 = 250 vehicles sold.

6.1 Introduction
Ponmozhi is at her cousin’s wedding which has a large gathering of people. There are a 
few hundred people, for sure. Suddenly her uncle comes and says, “We are getting ready 
to serve the meal; one of you quickly count the number of people and tell me”. “Ponmozhi, 
you are good at counting; Do this quickly and tell to me, I will be inside, getting the 
plantain leaves ready.”
It will be very tedious to count each and everyone assembled there. Ponmozhi is standing 
on a chair and is trying to count everyone. Suddenly, Ponmozhi is unsure of the count that 
she made and she did not want to count the same head more than once.
Ponmozhi was told that the task of counting was not easy. While counting, some people 
may leave, some may enter and some may move here and there. So it is difficult to make 
sure that her  count would be correct.

But in a wedding feast it does not matter if there is a small error  in the count: Whether 
there are 384 persons or 417 persons in the hall it does not really make much of a 
difference. Food made ready for 400 persons can be sufficient for 20 more persons. 
Mathematics will help not only in exact counting but also in estimation and approximate 
counting, depending on what is actually needed.
Instead of the above wedding hall situation, counting the number of children in the 
classroom is very easy. But counting the number of people in the wedding hall is difficult. 
There are many reasons for this.
The number of children in the classroom is small, in 10s rather than 100s. Children sit 
in the benches, the same number on each bench and the benches are organized in rows 
and columns. Children sit in one place when you are counting. The number is too small 
to ask the children to count starting from the left of the first row to the right of the last 
row, as the children themselves have collectively counted the number present in the 
class. But again we need not do this. If 3 children sit on each bench and there are 3 
benches in a row and there are 4 rows, and every bench in the class is fully occupied, 
then we have 3 × 3 × 4 = 36 children in class. But what should we do if all benches 
are not occupied full? If there are 3 benches with only 2 children and one bench with 
only one child, we only need to subtract (3+2) from 36 to get 31 children in the class. 
Importantly, not only we can get the answer, but also we can be confident that everyone 
was counted, and that nobody was left uncounted or counted twice.
The absence of these factors makes counting in wedding halls more difficult. In general, 
we can say:

The place in which the things are counted is fixed and arranged in some order, then 
counting is easy, otherwise it is difficult.
This suggests that the things should be in order if it is needed to be counted easily.

6.2 Systematic listing
There are two shorts and three shirts. In how many different combinations can you wear them?
At a time you are going to pick one of the shorts and different shirts. We denote the shorts 
as A and B, and the shirts as p, q and r. Then you can wear one of these: A p, A q, A r, B p, 
B q and B r.
Thus you have six different combinations and you know that you have counted all the 
possibilities. This is systematic listing.
Situation 1
Your friend has built a house with three floors. He  wants  
to  paint  each  floor  with  three  different colours 
red, blue and green. Can you help him to find 
different ways of possible colour combinations to 
paint the home?
In how many ways can his house be painted with 
these three colours?
Let us consider the floors as the Third floor, the 
Second floor and the First floor. We can say that

Information Processing
the painting can be done as RBG, BRG, GRB…etc. But here it is possible that we may miss 
out some patterns of colours. So, we can use systematic listing  as given below.
Step 1: Fix one colour; try the possible arrangements with other colours. For example, 
if the Third floor is fixed as Red, then we get 2 ways which is shown in the table below.
Fix Third floor Colour Second floor Colour First floor Colour
Red Blue Green
Red Green Blue
Step 2: If the Third floor is fixed as Blue, then we get another 2 ways which is shown in 
the table below.
Fix Third floor Colour Second floor Colour First floor Colour
Blue Green Red
Blue Red Green
Step 3: If the Third floor is fixed as Green, then we get 2 more ways which is shown in 
the table below.
Fix Third floor Colour Second floor Colour First floor Colour
Green Blue Red
Green Red Blue
Hence, we get 6 different ways of painting the three floors, which are R-B-G, R-G-B, 
B-G-R, B-R-G, G-B-R and G-R-B.
Situation 2
Suppose you want to write four digit numbers by using the digits 3, 6, 9 and 5. What are 
the possible numbers you can write using each digit exactly once?
If you list randomly, for example 9365, 3695, 5639 and so on, you may not write all the 
possibilities. So, write in ascending order.
 ● All numbers beginning with 3:
Fix next digit and change the other 2 digits. We get, 3569, 3596, 3659, 3695, 3956, 3965.
Similarly,
 ● All numbers beginning with 5  : 5369, 5396, 5639, 5693, 5936, 5963
 ● All numbers beginning with 6 : 6359, 6395, 6539, 6593, 6935, 6953
 ● All numbers beginning with 9 : 9356, 9365, 9536, 9563, 9635, 9653
 Totally, we can have 6+6+6+6 = 24 numbers

6.3 Systematic completion of lists
Suppose that you are already given a list that is partially filled. How would you complete 
it? In the activity with 4-digit numbers we had experienced this already. The idea is to find 
how the filled in part is arranged and use the same idea to complete the rest.
6.3.1  Sudoku 
Sudoku is a number game. Completion with some constraints is best enjoyed in Sudoku. 
This is a puzzle where there is a partially filled in grid. Horizontal lines of cells in the  grid 
are called as rows and vertical lines of cells in the grid are called as columns. In 9x9 
Sudoku, you have to fill in the remaining blank cells with numbers from 1 to 9 so that no 
number repeats in a row, or in a column. In 3x3 Sudoku, you can use only the numbers 
from 1 to 3. In 4x4 Sudoku, you can use only the numbers from 1 to 4 and so on.
(i) 3X3 Sudoku
Sudoku
The word Sudoku comes 
from the Japanese language. Su means 
‘number’ and Doku means ‘single’. It 
refers to the condition that each number 
is listed only once in each row, column. 
The modern version of this puzzle is said 
to have come from Howard Garns.

6.3.2  Magic triangle 
Magic triangles are also very interesting in a similar way.
In a magic triangle, numbers are to be filled without repetition on the sides of a triangle. 
So that the sum of each side remains the same.
Fill up the circle with the numbers from 1 to 6 without repetition so that each side of the 
magic triangle adds upto 12.
Fig. 6.14
Step 1: Place the larger numbers at the corners of the triangle i.e., 4 ,5, and 6.
Step 2: Place the smaller numbers i.e., 1,2 and 3 in the middle of each side.

(ii) Solution
A, B, C, D, & E are five triangles. 
No combination of these triangles taken 2 at a time, form 
any triangle.
Only  the combinations of A, F & C; A, F & D; B, F & E;  B, 
F & D and C, F & E form triangles when taken 3 triangles at 
a time. Hence, the total number of triangles = 5 + 5 = 10.
