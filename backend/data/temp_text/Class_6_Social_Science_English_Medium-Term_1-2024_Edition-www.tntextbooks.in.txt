Introduction
 & Your brother asks you what your height 
i
s. How will you measure it and tell him?
 & Your friends decide to play kabbadi. 
How will you measure and draw the 
border lines?
 & Your father gives you a bag and asks 
you to get potatoes. How will you ask 
the shopkeeper? 
 & Your mother gets milk from the milkman 
daily. How much does she get? 
 & How long will it take to reach your 
school from your house?
 & How does the shopkeeper measure 
kerosene while selling it?
To do the tasks given above, we 
need to know about measurement. The 
comparison of unknown quantities with 
some known quantities is known as 
measurement. Measurement of a quantity 
has two parts: a number and a unit.
To measure the quantities we need 
measuring tools. What are the measuring 
tools that you know? Which of those tools 
you will use to do the tasks listed above 
and the similar ones?

We hear the terms related to 
measurement 
like weight, kilogram, litres, 
millilitres, kilometre, length, distance etc. 
In this chapter let’s study in detail about 
length, mass and time and the necessity 
to measure them. 
1 .1 Length
What is length? The distance between 
one point and the other desir
ed point is 
known as length. It may be the distance 
between the edges of your book or the 
corners of the football ground in your 
school or even from your home to school.
The standard unit of length is 
'metre'. It is represented by the letter 
‘m’. Very small lengths can be measured 
in millimetre (mm) and centimetre (cm). 
Larger measures, say height of a building, 
length of a banner or height of a lamp post 
are all measured in metre. How to express 
still longer lengths say, distance between 
two cities or villages or distance between 
your school and home? It is expressed in 
kilometre (km).
Know the unit of length
1 km (kilometre) =  1000 m (metre)
1 m   (metre) =   100 cm (centimetre)
1 cm (centimetre) =   10 mm (millimetre)
Think: Can you express 1 km in cm?
Let us measure the length of your 
pencil.
1. Take the meter scale
2. Notice the lines with marking 1,2,3,4 ... 
till 15 (for smaller scales) or 30 (bigger 
scales). The distance between two 
numbers (say between 1 and 2) denotes 
a centimetre (written as ‘cm’).

From the activity 1, you see that 
your 
measurement is different from 
that of your friends. Similarly different 
measuring units are used in different 
countries.
For the sake of uniformity, scientists 
all over the world have adopted a common 
set of units to express measurements. 
This system is called as the International 
System of Units or SI Units.
• SI unit for length is metre
• SI unit for mass is kilogram
• SI unit for time is second
• SI unit for area is m 2
• SI unit for volume is m 3
Prefix
Multiples and sub-multiples of SI 
units 
are given as prefixes. Some prefixes 
are given in the table.
3. Notice, in between 1 and 2 there will 
be smaller markings. If you count, 
there will be 9 such lines. The distance 
between any two consecutive smaller 
markings within a ‘cm’ denotes a 
millimetre (written as ‘mm’).
Why do we need SI Units?
Activity 1
Form a group of 5 members. Select 
one person 
and let others measure her/
his height individually using hand span 
and cubit. Compare your answers with 
others. Do you find 
any difference? Why? 
Now you all stand in 
front of a wall and 
mark your height on 
the wall. Measure your 
height with a scale. 
What differences do 
you infer?

Corrective measures for  Measurement
Measurement has to be accurate and 
the approach has to be corr
ect always. 
In our day to day life approximation 
may not have much impact. But it has a 
large impact in scientific calculations. For 
example, if the curvature of key (lock and 
key) is changed even by 1 mm, the lock 
would not open. So, measurements have 
to be accurate in scientific calculations. 
Let us look at some common mistakes 
that occur while using a scale.
To measure the length of a pin
01
cm
23456789 10 11 12 13 14 15
• The head of the pin has to coinci de 
with ‘0’ of the scale.
• Count the number of centimetre and 
from there count the number of finer 
divisions. The count of the division is 
in ‘mm’
• In the above example the length of 
pin is 2 cm and 6 mm.
• Write the correct submultiple 
completely.
Note:
• Alw
ays keep the object parallel to the 
scale.
• Start the measurement from ‘0’ of the 
scale.
Parallax Error
Parallax is a displacement or difference 
in the 
apparent position of an object viewed 
along two different lines of sight.
Correct position of the eye is also 
important for taking measurement. 
Your eye must be vertically above the 
point where the measurement has to be 
Activity 2 
Aim: To find the length of 
a curv
ed line using a string.
Materials needed:  A meter scale,  
a measuring tape, a string and  
a sketch pen
Method:
• Draw a curved line AB on a piece 
of paper
• Place a string along the curved 
line. Make sure that the string 
covers every bit of the curved line.
• Mark the points where the curved 
line begins and ends on the string. 
• Now, stretch the string along the 
length of a meter scale and measure 
the distance between the two 
markings of the string and note it.
• This will give you the length of a 
curved line.
     
Find the length of a banana.

A B C 1 .2 Mass
Mass is the measure of the amount 
of mat
ter in an object. The SI unit of 
mass is kilogram. It is represented by 
‘kg’. Weight is the gravitational pull 
experienced by matter. The weight is 
directly proportional to the mass on the 
Earth's surface. 
Hold a sheet of paper in one hand 
and a book in other hand. Which hand 
feels the heaviness? The mass of the 
book is more than that of a single sheet 
of paper. Therefore, the pull on the book 
is more than that is on the paper. Hence, 
our hand needs more force to hold a book 
than a piece of paper. The force what we 
experience is called as ‘heaviness’.
On the moon where 
the gr
avitational force is 
less than that is on the 
earth, the weight will 
reduce but the mass will remain same. 
The moon’s gravitational pull is one 
sixth of the earth’s pull. Thus objects 
weigh six times lighter on the Moon 
than on the Earth.
What is your mass? If you measure it 
in 
grams, that would be a huge number. 
Is it not? So, it is expressed in kilogram. 
Bigger weights are measured in tonne or 
metric tonne.
1000 milligram =  1 gram
1000 gram =  1 kilogram
1000 kilogram =  1 tonne
Activity 3 
Aim: Measuring the length of 
a 
curved line using a divider.
A
B
Draw a curved line AB on a piece of paper.
Separ
ate the legs of the divider by 0.5 cm  
or 1 cm using a ruler.
Place it on the curved line starting 
from one end. Mark the position of 
the other end. Move it along the line 
again and again cutting the line into 
number of segments of equal lengths. 
The remaining parts of the line can 
be measured using a scale. Count the 
number of segments.
Therefore, the length of the line = 
(Number of segments × Length of each 
segment) + Length of the left over part.
taken. In the above representation, to 
av
oid parallax error, reading from B will 
be correct. From positions ‘ A’ and ‘C’, the 
readings wil
l be different and erroneous.

laboratories for weighing chemicals 
to ensur
e a precise measurement of 
those chemicals for using in various 
experiments. Electronic balances may 
also be used to weigh food, other grocery 
items, as well as jewellery.
1 .3 Time
Day changes into night and night in 
to day
. Seasons also change. We know 
time also changes. How do we measure 
change of time? Clocks are used to 
measure time. You know how to read a 
clock face and note the time. You can 
also use your pulse to measure the time 
roughly. Count the number of pulses. 
That can tell you the time elapsed. 
Activity 5 : Ask four or five of your 
fri
ends to run a race from one end of 
the school to the other end. Mark the 
starting point and the ending point. 
Using your pulse (or counting by 
counting 1,2,3,.....) count the time 
taken by each of them to complete 
the race. Check who is fast? 
Beam Balance
 We use beam balance to measure 
mass. A beam balance works b
y comparing 
the mass of an object to that of known 
mass (called a standard mass).Activity 4
Construct your own beam balance 
using two scr
apped coconut shells, 
strings or twines, thick cardboard as 
frame and a little sharpened pencil as 
index needle.
What can you achieve?
1. Find which object is heavier.
2. Find the approximate weight of 
lighter things like leaves, piece of 
papers etc.
Electronic Balance
An electronic balance is a device 
used to 
find the accurate measurements 
of weight. It is used very commonly in

Fast Facts
An odometer is a device used for 
indicating 
distance travelled by an 
automobile.
The metric system or standard set of 
units was created by the French in 
1790.
A ruler or scale, used now a days 
to measure length, was invented by 
William Bedwell in the 16th century.
A standard metre rod made of an alloy 
of platinum and iridium is placed at 
the Bureau of Weights and Measures 
in Paris. National Physical Laboratory 
in Delhi has a copy of this metre rod.
One kilogram is equal to the mass of 
a certain bar of platinum-iridium alloy 
that has been kept at the International 
Bureau of Weights and Measures in 
Sèvres, France since 1889.
Numerical Problems
Look at a meter scale carefully and 
answer the f
ollowing.
• How many millimieter divisions are 
there in a centimeter?
• How many centimeter divisions are 
there in a meter?
Complete the following.
 ¾ 7875 cm        =      m     cm
 ¾ 1195 m            =      km     m
 ¾ 15 cm 10 mm =      mm
 ¾ 45 km 33 m    =      m.
In the earlier days, 
people used sand 
clock 
and sundial to 
measure the passage 
of time during day time. The 
shadow cast by a stick can be used 
to estimate time. A vessel having a 
small hole is filled with sand and it 
is used as a clock. The sand in the 
vessel is allowed to come down and 
it is used to estimate the time. 
Sand Clock
These are rough methods for counting 
passage of 
time. We can use electronic 
clock, stopwatch and other instruments 
to count even smaller durations of time.

Some open ended questions
• During your school sport day, it is 
planned to conduct a mi
ni marathon 
race within the school campus. They 
decided that the running distance 
be 2 kilometres. Is it possible to 
have a school campus with the 
circumference of 2km? Discuss with 
your friends, how big the campus 
should be. Give other options if it is 
not a big campus.
• Is the distance in the sea also 
calculated in kilometres? How is it 
possible to calculate the distance in 
sea water? Explore!
• We know that the distance between 
celestial bodies is calculated in terms 
of light year. Light year is the distance 
travelled by light in one year. Now 
without calculator find how many 
kilometres light would have travelled 
in a year. Get the speed of light from 
your teacher.
• We see that the distances between 
Chennai and Madurai is written as 
462  km. But from which point to which 
point is this distance calculated?. As we 
are science students we need to know 
it with the precision. Is it between the 
two bus stands? Or between the two 
railway stations? Discuss and figure 
it out. Check your answers with your 
teacher.
• A person needs to drink two litres of 
water a day. Note down how much 
water you drink each day? Make a 
rough calculation and check if you 
are drinking the required amount 
of water.
Points to Remember
• The comparison of an unknown  
quantity with some known quantity is 
known as measurement.
• All physical quantities have standard 
units for the sake of uniformity.
• Length, mass and time are some of 
the fundamental physical quantities.
• The SI units are:
Length - metre
Mass - kilogram
Time - second
• While using a ruler, the accurate 
measurement can be arrived by 
avoiding three types of possible errors.
• Electronic balance is an instrument 
which provides accurate measurement 
of mass correct upto milligram.

Introduction
We have studied in our earlier classes 
that push 
or pull results in some motion of 
the object. When we open the door or kick 
a football or lift our school bag, motion is 
involved and there is some push or pull. 
2.1 Motion and Rest
What is rest? What is motion?
Suppose there is a book on your table 
right i
n the middle. Is the book moving? 
You will say it is not moving; it is at rest. 
If you push the book to one side of the 
table to clear the space for keeping your 
notebook, then you will say the book 
is moving.  When the book was at the 
same place with respect to the table, it 
was at rest; but when it was pushed from 
one place on the table to another place, 
it was moving.
Activity 1
Can you identify whether it is push or pull that results in motion in the following 
cases?
Push / Pull
 Push / Pull

Anitha and Babu are standing under a 
tree 
at the bus stand waiting for a bus 
to Madurai. Two of their friends, Reka 
and Mohan, get into a bus to go to 
Thanjavur. The bus starts.
Hey Babu! would 
you sa
y that Mohan 
is in motion?
How can you say that?  
I can see he’s just sitting 
in the bus!
Yes,  
of course.
No, Mohan is not. He is 
just si
tting in one place!
Reka, do you think 
mohan is moving?
Yes, but 
the bus
 
is moving 
isn’t it?
So what?
You never 
believe me. 
Ask Reka.
Anitha tells this to 
Babu. 
He snatches 
the phone from 
her and says 
irritably to Reka,
Can’t you see 
that the bus has 
moved away from 
the tree? Mohan is 
in the bus hence 
Mohan is moving 
along with the bus.
Hi! Am I moving 
or at rest?
But I am also in the bus! To me it does 
not look as if Mohan is moving. He isn’t 
moving towards me or away from me.
When there is a change in the position of an object with respect to time, then it is 
call
ed motion. If it remains stationary it is called rest.

gran
dmother's 
house by bicycle.  
Sitting on the 
bicycle, Nisha is  
  
with respect to 
the road.
She is _____________  with respect to 
the bicycle.
Take the case of a book on a table at 
rest. Is it really without any motion? We 
know that Earth is rotating on its axis; 
therefore the table along with the book 
must be rotating. Is it not? We are also 
moving along with the earth. Therefore, 
from the point of view of the ground on 
which we stand, the book is at ‘rest’. 
Similarly, while travelling in a bus, we feel 
that the poles and trees seem to move 
backwards, and the things inside the bus 
are stationary.
Discuss: Who is correct? Is Mohan 
really in motion? 
We can clearly say that both Reka and 
Babu 
are correct. From the point of view 
of Babu, Mohan along with the bus is in 
motion; but for Reka who is sitting beside 
him, he is at one place; therefore stationary. 
So, according to Babu, Mohan is in motion; 
Mohan is at rest from Reka's observation. 
Can you think any other examples?
Answer by observing the 
situat
ion in the picture
Event 1: The man in the boat is moving 
with respect to the bank of river. He is at 
rest with respect to the boat.
Event 2:
The gi
rl on the swing is   
with respect to the 
seat of the swing. 
She is      with 
respect to the 
garden.
Event 3: Nisha 
An object may appear to be 
stationary 
for one observer and appear 
to be moving for another. An object is at 
rest in relation to a certain set of objects 
and moving in relation to another set of 
objects. This implies that rest and 
motion are relative.  
Am I at rest  
or i
n motion?

18
How things move?
When we kick a ball it moves. When 
we push 
the book on the table, it moves. 
When a bullock pulls, the cart moves. 
Motion occurs when an object is pulled or 
pushed by an agency. 
Activity 2
Moon or Cloud?
Observe the moon on a windy night 
with a 
fair bit of cloud cover in the sky. 
As the cloud passes in front of the moon 
you sometimes think it is the moon 
which is moving behind the cloud. 
What would you think if you were to 
observe a tree at the same time? 
Why don’t we  
try an
y inanimate 
agency?
In our daily life, we pull out water 
from the well using bucket. Animals pull 
a bullock cart. It is a person or animal, 
that is an animate agency that does the 
pushing or pulling. 
Sometimes we see a tall grass in 
the meadow dancing in the wind or a 
piece of wood moving down a stream. 
What pushes or pulls them? We know 
that blowing wind and flowing water 
is the cause. Sometimes the push 
or pull can be due to the inanimate 
agency. 
Forces are push or pull by an animate 
or inanimate 
agency. 
Contact, Non-contact Forces
Forces can be classified into two major 
types;
 contact and non-contact forces.

What happens when we apply a 
force on an object?
What happens when you apply a force 
on an object? Say
, you push a book on 
the table. The book moves. Application 
of force in an object results in motion 
from a state of rest. 
What happens when a batsman hit a 
ball? The ball is already in motion, but with 
the strike, the speed of the ball increases. 
Moreover the direction of the ball changes. 
Application of force on an object results in 
a change in its speed and change in its 
direction.
When we crush a balloon or press roti 
dough or pull a rubber band, the shape 
of the object changes on application of 
force. Application of force in object results 
in expansion or contraction.
Wind making a flag flutter, a bullock pulling 
a cart 
are contact forces. Magnetism, 
gravity are some examples of non-contact 
forces. 
In all the above cases, the force 
is executed by touching the body. So, 
this type of forces are called contact 
forces.
Mysteriously, ripen coconut falls to the 
ground. What pulls it to the ground? We 
would have heard about ‘force of gravity’ 
of Earth. Gravity pulls the ripen coconut 
from the tree to the ground. 
Hey! Who is 
pulli
ng me?
When we bring a magnet near a small 
iron nail, the nail jumps into the air and 
sticks with the magnet. Observe that the 
magnet and the nail did not touch each 
other. Still, there was a pulling force 
that made the nail to jump towards the 
magnet. In these two examples, the force 
is applied without touching the object. 
Such forces are known as non-contact 
forces.
20
In a nutshell, we can say that the 
applied f
orce is an interaction of one 
object on another that causes the second 
object to move from rest, speed up, 
slow down, stop the motion, change the 
direction, compress or expand.
Forces can
1. Change the states of a body from 
rest to motion or motion to rest.
2. Either change the speed or direction or 
both of the body.
3. Change the shape of the body.
Look at this picture. The person is 
applyi
ng force to stop the cart from 
moving. When the force is applied against 
the direction of the motion, the speed can 
be reduced, or even the motion is stopped 
completely. Discuss what happens when 
you apply break in a speeding bicycle.

A fly buzzing around the room is a 
combinati
on of all these motions and 
flight path is zigzag.
You can classify the motion according 
to the path 
taken by the object. 
a. Linear motion - Motion in a straight line. 
Eg. A person walking on a straight path.
We can say that the motion of the 
pencil was rotational, circular, straight 
line or linear and later oscillatory. 
Throw paper aeroplanes or paper dart. 
Watch its flight path when you throw it at 
an angle. The path curves i.e the paper 
flight is moving ahead but its direction is 
changing while moving. Such paths are 
called curvilinear. 
Activity 4
Play with pencil  
Do what Shanthi did...
(i) 
Shanthi took a pencil and sharpened it with a sharpener. (ii) Then she drew a 
circle using the pencil and a compass. (iii) Later she took her ruler (scale) and drew 
a straight line in another paper. (iv) Then she kept the pencil between her fingers 
and moved it back and forth.  
Now, look at the motion of the pencil in all these four cases. How was it? 
(i) 
In the first case, the pencil rotated in its axis.  
(ii) In the second case, it went in a circle.  
(iii) In the third case, the pencil travelled in a straight line.  
(iv)  In the fourth case, the pencil tip moved back and forth, that is it oscillated 
like a swing.
2.2. Types of motion
22
b. Curvilinear motion - Motion of a body  
moving ahead but changing direction. 
Eg. Motion of a ball thrown.
c. Circular motion - Motion in a circle. 
Eg. Swirling stone tied to the rope.
d. Rotatory motion - Motion of a body 
about its own axis. Eg. Rotating top.
e. Oscillatory motion - A body coming back 
to the same position after a fixed time 
interval. Eg. A pendulum.
f. Zigzag (irregular) - The motion of a 
body in different direction. Eg. People 
walking in a crowded street.
Activity 5 
Hi! Friends! Tell me what type of motion.  
I am 
in.
Linear Motion
Oscillations at 
Greater Speed
Ask your friend to 
hold the two ends of a
 
stretched rubber band. Strike it in the 
middle. Do you see that it oscillates 
very fast? When the oscillation is very 
swift, it is called as vibration.
Fast oscillations are referred 
to as vibrations.

Activity 6
Classify the following according to the path it takes. 
Linear, Curvilinear, Circular, Rotatory, Oscillatory, Zigzag (irregular) 
• A sprinter running a 100 m race
• A coconut f
alling from a tree
• Striking a coin in a carom board game
• Motion of flies and mosquitoes

• Bouncing ball
[Add five motions you observe to this list]
24
All oscillatory motions 
are 
periodic, but not all 
periodic motion are 
oscillatory motion.
Fast Vs Slow?
Look at a tall tree. When the wind is 
gentle, 
its branches are dancing slowly; 
but if the gentle wind becomes strong, the 
branches shake violently, and if the speed 
increases further, the branch may even 
break and fall. That is the motion can be 
slow or fast. Can we say a motion is slow 
or fast without comparing anything?
Compared to walking, cycling is fast, 
but a 
bus is faster than a cycle. The 
aeroplane is much faster than a bus. 
So, slow or fast is a relative concept 
which depends upon the motions we are 
comparing. Then how do we say a body 
moves at a particular speed?
Periodic and non- periodic motions
Take the case of the hour-hand of a 
clock. In 
one day it makes two rounds. 
Look at a bouncing ball. It bounces a 
certain number of times for a given time 
interval or period. Look at the water waves. 
In a given period that is in a time interval, 
a fixed number of waves hit the shore. 
Motion repeated in equal intervals of time 
is called as periodic motion. 
Let us take the example of sapling 
swing 
in wind. This motion is not in 
uniform interval. Such motions are called 
non-periodic motion.
Revolution of the Moon around the 
Earth is periodic but not oscillatory. 
However, the children playing in a swing 
is both periodic and oscillatory.  
Speed.
I have travelled 160 km in 
two hours.
T
axi Driver
Bus Driver
 Truck Driver
I have travelled 200 km in four hours.
I have travelled 300 km in five hours.
Can you say who travelled with 
highest speed?
25
A bus takes three hours to cover 
a di
stance of 180 kilometres. Then its 
speed is given as:
Speed (s)  =   Distance travelled (d) / 
Time taken (t)
 =  180 kilometre/ 3 hour
 =  60 kilometre / hour
Note that metre/second or kilometre/
hour comes next to our answer for
 
speed. What is it?
Observe the formula for speed. If 
we denote the distance in metre and 
time by second then the unit of speed 
is metre/second. If we denote the 
distance in kilometre and time in hour 
then the unit of speed is kilometre/
hour. Sometimes we use units like 
centimetre/second.
In science we generally use SI units. 
In SI units the unit of distance is metre 
and the unit of time is second. So, the SI 
unit of speed is metre/second.
Let us calculate
1.  A car travelled 150 metre in 10 second. 
What i
s its speed?
2.  Priya rides her bicycle 40 km in two 
hours. What is her speed?
Let us calculate how long they 
tra
velled in one hour?
• Distance travelled by the car in  
one hour  =   80    km (160/2)
• Distance travelled by the bus in  
one hour  =        km
• Distance travelled by the truck in  
one hour  =       km
Have you found out? Say now.
Who is fast?       , 
Who is slow?      
Have you noticed that saying who 
is fast or slow is easy when we 
calculate the distance they travelled 
in one hour? In other words, you divide 
the distance travelled by the time taken 
to get the speed. 
Suppose a car travels 300 km in one 
hour. Then we say that the speed of the 
car is ‘300 kmph’ (We read it as ‘three 
hundred kilometres per hour’). 
If an object travelled 10 metre in 
2 second, then its speed is given as: 
Speed (s)  =   Distance travelled (d) / 
Time taken (t)
 =  10 metre/ 2 second
 =  5 metre / second
The distance travelled by an object 
in uni
t time is called speed of the 
object.
If an object travelled a distance 'd' in 
time 't' then, its speed is given as: 
Speed (s)  =  Distance travelled 
Time tak
en  = d 
t
26
If a ship travelled at a speed of 50 
kmph and 
it sailed for five hours, how 
much distance it has travelled?  
Distance = s ×  t 
 = 50 kmph  × 5 h = 250 km 
If we know the speed and distance 
travelled we can compute the time taken. 
s =  d
t  or t =  d
s   
Time tak
en = Distance travelled / Speed
Suppose a bus travels at a speed of 
50 kmph and has to cover a distance of 
300 km, how much time will it take? 
t =  d
s  =  300 km/50 kmph = 6 h. 
Compute the following Numerical 
Problems.
1. If you travel 10 kilometres in 2 hours, 
y
our speed is     km per hour.
2. If you travel 15 kilometres in 1/2 hour, 
you would travel     km in one hour, 
and your speed is     km per hour.
3. If you run fast at 20 kilometres per hour 
for 2 hours, you will cover     km
If you know the speed  of an object 
and the time taken by it, then we can 
compute how much distance it had 
travelled.
We know that,
Speed = 
Distance travelled
Time tak

s = d
t  or st = d
Therefore, the distance travelled  
(d) = speed  (s ) × time (t).
d = s ×  t

Let us play a small game. Go to the playground with your friends. Mark 100 metre 
distance f
or a race. Conduct a friendly running race and calculate the time taken by 
them to complete the distance. Now record the time in the table.
Usain Bolt crossed 100 metre in 9.58 
seconds and made a world r
ecord. If 
you are able to run faster than him,  
then Olympic Gold Medal is waiting 
for you.

moved some distance i t will gather speed. 
After that it may slow down while crossing 
bridges and stop at intermediate stations for 
passengers. Finally, as the train approaches 
Madurai, again it will slow and finally will 
come to a halt. It means that the speed is 
not the same all through the journey. That 
is, the speed is non-uniform. This motion is 
said to be non-uniform motion. 
However, in between the journey, there 
may be a stretch where in the train might 
go at a constant speed. During that interval 
the train will be moving at uniform speed. 
That is, its motion is uniform.

is the fastest land animal

are 
combinations of many types of 
motion. 
Multiple Motion
Look at the bicycle in the picture. What 
type of moti
on does the wheel perform? 
What type of motion does the cycle in 
total perform? 
The tyres rotate and make a rotatory 
motion, but the cycle as such moves 
forward in a linear path. 
Many motions we see in our day to day 
life are non-uniform. We will learn more 
about uniform and non-uniform motion in 
higher classes. 
If an object covers uniform distances 
in uniform intervals then the motion 
of the object is called uniform motion. 
Otherwise the motion is called non-
uniform motion.
In a nutshell, we can classify the 
motion in terms of a) path b) if it is 
periodic or not c) if the speed is uniform

Simple Spinner
Let us enjoy by making a simple spinner. Make it by 
the f
ollowing instruction.
Cut a 2cm long piece from an old ball-pen refill and 
make a hole in its center with a divider point (Fig. 1).
Take a thin wire of length 9cm and fold it into a 
U-shape (Fig. 2).
Weave the refill spinner in the U-shaped wire (Fig. 3).
Wrap the two ends of the wire on the plastic refill, 
leaving enough clearance for the spinner to rotate 
(Fig. 4).
On blowing through the refill, the spinner rotates (Fig. 5).
For obtaining maximum speed adjust the wires so that air is directed towards  
the ends of the spinner.
Have you enjoyed with simple spinner? Do you observe the motions in the toy? Can 
you answer the following questions?
 1. Motion of the air in tube is         motion.
 2. Motion of the refill stick is         motion.
 3. The toy converts         motion into         motion.

A bipedal humanoid robot.
The term 
'robot' comes from a czech 
word, ‘robota’ meaning ‘forced labour’. 
Robotics is the science and study of robots.
What can Robots do?
Robots can sense and respond to their 
surroundi
ngs. They can handle delicate 
objects or apply great force. For example, 
they can perform eye operations guided 
by a human surgeon, or assemble a car. 
With artificial intelligence , robots 
will also be able to make decisions for 
themselves.
How do Robots sense?
Electronic sensors function as robot’s

2.3 Science Today -  Robot
Robots are automatic machines. 
Some r
obots can perform mechanical and 
repetitive jobs faster and more accurately 
than people. Robots can also handle 
dangerous materials and explore distant 
planets. 
30
sensors give the robot a sense of touch, 
to judge 
how to grip an egg or heavy 
luggage. Built-in computers send and 
receive information with radio waves. 
Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence attempts to 
create 
computer programs that think like 
human brains. Current research has not 
achieved this, but some computers can be 
programmed to recognize faces in a crowd.
Can Robots think?
Robots can think. They can play 
complex 
games, such as chess, better 
than human beings. But will a robot ever 
know that it is thinking? Humans are 
conscious - we know we are thinking. 
But we do not know how consciousness 
works. We do not know if Robots can 
ever be conscious.

very small spaces to perform a function. 
Future nanobots could be placed in the blood 
stream to perform surgical procedures that 
are too delicate or too difficult for standard 
surgery. Imagine if a nanobot could target 
cancer cells and destroy them without 
touching healthy cells nearby.

Points to Remember
• Motion and rest are relative.
• Al
l things that are at rest may seem to 
be in motion from a different point of 
view, and all motion may seem to be 
at rest from a different perspective. 
• Application of forces is implemented by 
a push or pull. Forces can be applied by 
animate as well as inanimate agency. 
• Application of forces result in motion of 
an object at rest, increase or decrease 
its speed, change its direction, and 
distortion of the shape. 
• Some forces act only when they are in 
contact. There are some forces which 
can even have effect at a distance.
• Speed = Distance travelled / Time 
taken (s=  d/t)
• The motion can be classified according 
to the path (periodic or non-periodic) 
or according to speed (uniform or 
non-uniform).
• Unit of speed is m/s.

Introduction
Matter is everywhere around us. The 
air 
we breath, water we drink and the 
material we use are made up of matter. 
Matter is defined as anything that occupies 
space and has mass. Matter is found in 
three major states: solid, liquid and gas.  
Do you know what is matter made of? 
Matter is made of atoms. Atoms are 
the smallest particle of matter. They are so 
small that you cannot see them with your 
eyes or even with a standard microscope. 
A standard sheet of paper is about millions 
of atoms thick. Science has come up with 
a technology to identify the structure 
of atoms by using Atomic resolution 
Microscope (ARM) and Tunnelling Electron 
Microscope (TEM) which use electricity to 
map atoms. There is more about atoms in 
the later classes. But first let's learn about 
the three states of matter.
3.1 Physical Nature of Matter
Matter occupies space and has mass. 
What is its nature? Many philosophers 
pondered over this question and came out 
with ideas.
Imagine that a piece of thread is 
cut endlessly using knife. At one point 
it would be like a small piece that it 
cannot be further cut by a knife. That 
small particle may contain millions of 
molecules and these molecules are 
made of atoms. Matter is made of such 
smallest particles 'atoms'. These atoms 
are extremely small even to see under a 
powerful microscope.
Which of the shapes given above resemble a sugar crystal?
A        B      C       D     E      F
Now place a f
ew sugar crystals into water.
What happens to the sugar crystals?
A sugar crystal is also made up of molecules. When 
sugar dissolves in water, the sugar crystals break down 
and the molecules of sugar get distributed in water. 
This makes water sweet in taste. The sugar molecules 
are extremely small; that is why we are not able to see them. Small amount of 
matter has many millions of molecules in it (1 million = 10 lakhs).
Take a few crystals of sugar. Observe them carefully with the help of a magnifying lens.

Characteristics of the particles of 
matter
1. Particles of matter have a lot of space 
in 
between them. In different forms of 
matter this spacing will be different.
Let us add a spoon full of sugar to a 
glass of water. Stir well. Sugar disappears 
completely.  Where has it gone? Will the glass 
of water be now sweet? Water particles have 
space between them and sugar particles are 
now occupying those spaces.
2. Particles of matter attract each other. 
It is 
the force of attraction which keeps 
the particles together. This attractive force 
will be different for different forms of matter.
Grouping of Matter on the  basis of 
Physical states
These are the three physical states of 
mat
ter. Matter can be grouped into solids, 
liquids and gases based on the above 
characteristics. 
3.2  Mass, Shape and Volume of 
Solids, Liquids and Gases
Let us first take any solid say a stone: 
Answer the f
ollowing questions.
  Do you need a container to know the 
shape of a stone ? Yes / No
A solid does not need a container. 
It stays as it is because its particles are 
tightly packed and has a definite shape.
 If you move the stone from the ground 
to a table or place it on the shelf does 
it's shape change? Yes / No
If you take a stone from the ground 
and place it on the table or shelf its shape 
and volume do not change.
Pencil and books are used for 
studying. The buck

made of plastic while the table and ladle

your group members and note down 
your points.

broom are rough but the toy bear is soft. 
Light can pass through a glass of water 
and the spectacles but not through apple 
or iron box. The cow and the bird are 
living things while the rest are not. Water 
in the glass is liquid but air in the balloon 
is  gas and the rest are solids. The feather 
and the paper cup can float but not the 
apple or the piece of stone. The rubber 
band can be stretched but not the comb. 
Though they have different properties, 
they are matter.

You should have done it based on some 
pr
operties. Brick and door which are hard 
come under solids, things that flow come 
under liquids and others which are very 
light and can flow more freely come under 
gases.

3.3 Diffusion
Let us place a book on a table. Let it 
not be disturbed. Observ
e for five minutes.
Now take a glass of water and add a drop 
of ink carefully at the centre. Do not shake 
or stir.
Now light an incense stick and keep it 
in one corner of the room.
Let us answer the following questions.
• 
Did the book move?
• Did the ink particles move and spread 
itself in the water? How long did it take 
for complete mixing?
• Did you get the smell of the incense 
stick from where you are standing?
• How fast did you get the smell? How 
did the smell reach you?
We may conclude that the particles 
of gases and liquids can move easily 
and  quickly. This tendency of particles 
to spread out in order to occupy the 
available space is called diffusion. Solids 
are tightly packed and they do not diffuse 
like liquids or gases. Hence ink and smoke 
spread easily while book stays on the table. 
Particles in a Solid Particles in a Liquid Particles in a Gas
In solid, the particles 
are 
tightly packed with very 
little space between them.
Eg. Stone
Particles in liquids are 
arranged in a random or 
irregular way and the space 
between the particles is 
greater than that is in solids.
Eg. Water
The particles in the gases 
are arranged far apart. 
They move freely.

know mor
e about matter.
Test Yourself
1 Name an object which is brittle and 
transparent. 
2. Name an object which can be stretched. 
3. Name two objects which can be bent. 
3.4  Compressibility of gases 
compared to liquids and 
solids
Let us take three identical syringes. 
Close 
the nozzles 
tightly with a cork. After 
removing the plunger 
first let us fill it with 
fine chalk powder. Try 
to press plunger down. 
What do you observe?
Now let us fill the second one with 
water. Press the plunger down. What do 
you observe? Let us now draw the piston 
back to suck air into the third one. Press 
the plunger down. What do you observe? 
Is it easy or hard to press? Record your 
observations and share among the group 
members.
You would have observed that the 
plunger moved freely in syringe with air 
than in water. It was difficult to press the 
liquids and the piston hardly moved in 
chalk powder. Thus, we can conclude that 
gases are highly compressible as compared 
to liquids and solids.
We can say that air is also a matter. 
Though we cannot see it, it occupies 
Activity 4
Let us take two sachets of juice. In 
both the sachets, i
t is written 100ml. 
Let us empty two sachets and pour 
the juice into the following glasses.
• Does its shape change?  
Y
es / No
A liquid needs a container and 
it takes the shape of a container 
because the particles slide over 
one another and keep moving.
• Does its volume change when it is 
poured into a big glass as well as 
a small one? Yes / No
The amount of juice is the 
same in both glasses.
• How will you find out whether the 
volume has changed or not?
The volume of a liquid remains 
the same whether it is kept in a 
large container or a small one but 
its shape changes.
Activity 5
Lift an uninflated cycle tube. Inflate it 
and 
 now lift it again. Is there a change 
in the weight? Can we say that air 
has mass?

Think to learn
Solid  Liquid  Gas
'Liquef
action of gases' is the process by which substances in their gaseous state are 
converted to the liquid state. When the pressure on a gas is increased, its molecules come 
closer together, and the temperature is reduced. This removes enough energy to make it 
change from the gaseous state to the liquid state.

Lets summarize
S.no. Solids Liquids Gases
1. Definite shape and 
v
olume
No definite shape. Liquids 
attain the shape of the vessel 
in which they are kept.
Gases have neither a 
definite shape nor a 
definite volume.
2. Incompressible Compressible to a small extent. Highly compressible 
3. There is little space 
between solid 
particles. Particles 
are tightly packed 
or arranged.
These particles have a greater 
space between them. Particles 
are not tightly packed or 
arranged. They are free to 
move.
The space between gas 
particles is the greatest. 
Particles are very loosely 
packed or arranged.
4. These particles 
attract each other 
very strongly.
The force of attraction between 
liquid particles is less than 
solid particles. 
The force of attraction is 
least between gaseous 
particles. 
5. Particles of solid 
cannot move 
freely.
These particles move freely. Gaseous particles are in 
a continuous, random 
motion.

3.5  Pure Substances and 
Mixtures
In shops, we find products which are 
sold wi
th label 100% pure! For common 
people pure means unadulterated, does 
not contain any cheap or harmful additives. 
Are they really pure substances as they 
claim to be?
For a Chemist the word ‘pure’ means 
something else!
 A pure substance is made up of only 
one kind of particles.
 Pure substances may be elements or 
compounds.
 An element is made up of same kind of 
atoms. 
 A molecule consists of two or more 
atoms. 
 Compound is the substance formed 
by the chemical combination of two or 
more elements. 
 Mixture is a physical combination of 
two are more substances.

components of the mixture with our 
naked eyes?

nor separate the components physically.

Identify  the mixture  given in the table 
below. Write 'yes' for a mixture and 'no' if 
it is not a mixture. You may also write 'I 
do not know' and later discuss with your 
teacher.
Mixture Yes / No

Salt Solution
Air is a mixture because it contains 
oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water 
vapour, noble gases and other gases. Milk 
is also a mixture. It contains water, fat, 
protein etc.
Lemon juice is a mixture. Some of us 
like to have it with less sugar; while others 
like to have it with more sugar. But either 
way, it is still lemon juice - prepared from 
lemon extract, water and sugar and is a 
mixture though the amount of sugar added 
is different. Same way even if we add extra 
Let us consider the following examples. 
We all eat snacks. Can you identify and 
mention a few things that are present in 
a mixture or fruit mixture? You are able to 
identify the ingredients in them from their 
colours, appearance or taste.
We mix rice, dal, salt, chillies, pepper, 
ghee and 
other ingredients to make pongal. 
Pongal is also an example for mixture.
Why do we call these as mixtures? 
Because 
they are made of two or more 
ingredients or components that are 
physically separable.
6th Science_EM_Unit 3.indd   42 12/2/2022   2:25:31 PM
43
What is meant by separation? The 
pr
ocess by which the components of mixture 
are isolated and removed from each other 
to get pure substance is called separation. 
To know about the original properties and 
uses of the individual substance we need 
separation.
When and why do we need to separate 
mixtures?
 When we need to remove impurities or 
harmful components from the mixtures. 
Eg. Stones from rice.
 When the useful component has to 
be separated from other components. 
Eg. Petrol from petroleum.
 When a substance has to be obtained 
in highly pure form. Eg. Gold from gold 
mines.
Let us visit Selvi’s Family
It is 7 am and Selvi’s family is busy. 
At home, in the ki
tchen, Selvi’s mother 
is making tea for the family and her 
grandmother is separating butter from 
curds. Her father and uncle are out in the 
field collecting paddy after harvesting. 
Selvi is helping her mother to cook rice 
and is separating stones from the rice. 
Selvi’s little brother Balu is fascinated by 
a piece of magnet that was given by his 
friend and is playing outside in the sand 
with it.
Can you list out in your note book, 
the different activities that Selvi’s family 
members are engaged in?
Let us explore the different separating 
methods involved in the above activities 
and also learn about a few other methods.
water or lemon extract it will still be a 
mixture. A mixture need not have a fixed 
proportion of components.
• A mixture is an impure substance 
and contains more than one kind 
of particles.
• In the mixture the components 
are mixed in any proportion.
A mixture can be a physical combination 
of two or mor
e elements. Example: 22 carat 
gold which is composed of gold and copper 
or gold and cadmium.
It can be a physical combination of two 
or more compounds. Example: Aerated 
drink which is composed of carbon dioxide, 
water, sweetening and colouring agents.
It can be a physical combination of an 
element and a compound. Example: Tincture 
of iodine is composed of Iodine in alcohol.
3.6 Separation of Mixtures
Are all mixtures used as they are? 
Or 
is there a need for separating the 
components? Materials we use in our day-
to-day life are got from different sources 
and are very often combined with other 
substances.
Mixtures like coffee and ice cream 
are taken as such. There is no need for 
separation of this substances. Metals 
occur in the form of ores under the earth’s 
crust. But if we want to use a pure metal, 
we need to adopt a laborious process of 
extraction to separate the useful metal 
from the ore.

Churning
When very fine insoluble solids have to 
be separ
ated from a liquid as in butter from 
curd, churning is performed. 
The mixture is churned vigorously when 
solid butter will be collected on the sides 
of the vessel. Both butter and butter milk  
obtained after churning are useful and can 
be consumed.
In washing machines 
water is squeez
ed out 
from clothes and they 
are dried. This method 
is called centrifugation.
Threshing
When we pluck flowers from plants, 
we ar
e separating the flowers from their 
The choice of the method of separation 
depends upon the properties of the 
components of the mixture. The separation 
method may be based on the particle’s size, 
shape or physical state – solids, liquids or 
gases.
Filtering
Selvi’s mother used a strainer to remove 
the tea lea
ves to get the clear liquid. Larger 
sized particles of tea leaves will be retained 
by the strainer while the clear liquid will 
pass through. This is called filtering.
Will you discard the tea leaves after 
str
aining? Can you suggest a good way 
of using them?
Sieving
A sieve is similar to a strainer. Sieving  is 
used when we have to separate solid 
particles of different sizes. Eg: bran from 
flour, sand from gravel etc. Wire mesh as 
a strainer sieve is used to separate gravel 
from sand at a construction site.
Activity 6

separ
ate bran from flour?

Handpicking
How do we separate a stone from 
`rice? If the stones ar
e visible different 
from the grain, they can be easily picked 
and separated by hand. This is called 
handpicking . But if the stones look very 
similar to the rice grains it is difficult to 
separate.
Magnetic Separation
In a mixture containing iron, the 
magnetic pr
operty of iron can be used to 
separate it from non- magnetic substances 
by using a magnet. Substances that are 
attracted to a magnet are called magnetic 
substances. Separating solids using a 
magnet is called magnetic separation. 
stalks. Can we do the same for food 
gr
ains like rice and wheat? It is not 
possible because the grains are small in 
size and also the quantity is very large. 
Farmers separate grains from their stalks 
by beating them hard. The grains are 
separated from their stalks. This is called 
Threshing.
Winnowing 
Rice, wheat and other food grains are 
co
vered with husk which cannot be eaten 
by us. Husk is very light and gets easily 
blown away by a breeze or wind. The 
method used for removing husk from grain 
is called winnowing. 
This is done by dropping the mixture 
slowly f
rom a height in the presence of 
wind. Lighter solids i.e. husks will be 
carried by wind and will be collected 
in a separate heap while heavier solids 
i.e.  grains will fall closer and form 
a separate heap.
Rice husk also called 
chaff is the hard  
coating or protective 
covering on a seed or 
grains. It protects  the seed during the 
growing season. Husk can be used as 
building material, fertilizer, insulation 
material and fuel.
6th Science_EM_Unit 3.indd   46 12/2/2022   2:25:45 PM
47
Sedimentation
Rice and pulses are often mixed with 
very fine str
aw, husk or dust particles 
which have to be removed before cooking. 
Are you familiar with the way this is done 
at home? To remove these particles 
rice or pulses are washed in water. The 
lighter impurities float while heavier 
rice grains sink to the bottom. This is 
called sedimentation . The water with 
the impurities is carefully poured down 
leaving clean rice at the bottom. This is 
called decantation.
Separating mud from muddy water
Muddy water is a mixture of very fine 
particles of soil in water. What will happen 
if muddy water is left undisturbed for 
some time? Mud being heavy will settle 
down at the bottom of the beaker and 
will form the sediment. Water forms the 
top layer and is called the supernatant 
liquid.
The settling down of heavier 
components of a mixture when allowed to 
remain undisturbed for some time is called 
sedimentation.
Decantation 
This pr
ocess is done after 
sedimentation. The supernatant liquid 
is slowly poured out from the container 
without disturbing the sediment. The 
part that settles down the bottom of the 
liquid is called sediment. The water that 
is obtained after decantation is called the 
decantate. The process of separating liquid 
above the sediment is called decantation.
But even after decantation the water is 
not completely free from fine soil particles. 
How can we remove this? We can do this 
by filtration. Do you think a strainer or a 
cloth can filter theses very fine particles? 
Do it by yourself and find out.
Filtration
We use filter papers to remove the 
finer impuri
ties. A filter paper has very fine 
pores much smaller than soil particles. Let 
us see how to use the filter paper.
Take a piece of filter paper. Fold it to 
make a cone (see figure). Slowly pour 
the muddy water over the filter paper. On 
filtration clear water (filtrate) flows down 
the funnel and mud settles as residue on 
the filter paper. The method of separating 
insoluble component (sand, mud etc.) 
from a mixture using a filter paper is called 
filtration. The liquid which passes through 
the filter and comes down is called filtrate 
and the insoluble component left behind on 
the filter paper is called residue.

More to know:
Combination of methods ar
e used 
sometimes for complete separation .
If the mixture of sand and 
salt in water has to be separated 
several methods like sedimentation, 
decantation, filtration, evaporation 
and condensation are used.
Activity 7
Group Activity – Students are divided into four groups
Each gr
oup should suggest a method to separate mixtures and also give reasons 
why they used a particular method and what property of the components forms the 
basis for separation. Examples should be drawn from day-to-day life.  After 
the group presents its method to the rest of the class, the whole class will discuss 
and analyse if the suggested method will work and then make a note of it in the 
table given below.

3.7 Food Adulteration
Sometimes, things 
that we buy in the
 
market are mixed with 
harmful and unwanted 
substances. It is called 
adulteration. Food can also get adulterated 
due to carelessness or lack of proper 
handling.
We must be careful about the common 
adul
terants in our consumable goods 
especially in food. Any adulterated food 
when consumed will be harmful and can 
be a health hazard.
An adulterated substance will not 
indicate the true properties of the original 
substance. For example, used tea leaves 
are sometimes used as adulterants in tea.
Turmeric powder is adulterated with a 
bright yellow chemical which is poisonous 
to us.
Points to Remember
 Matter is anything that has mass and 
oc
cupies space.
 All matter is made up of extremely 
small particles called atoms.
 Matter is classified into solids, liquids 
and gases on the basis of two important 
factors.
 a. The way the particles are arranged
 b.  The way the particles attract each 
other.
 Difference between the properties 
of solids, liquids and gases is due to 
the difference in the arrangement of 
the particles and the nature of the 
attractive forces between them.
 A pure substance can be an element or 
a compound and it can be made up of 
only one kind of particles.
  A mixture is an impure substance 
containing two or more components 
physically mixed in any proportion.
 Separation of mixtures is done 
 1. to remove harmful components.
 2. to obtain the useful components.
 3.  to obtain a substance in a highly 
pure form.
In most houses people 
use 
commercial water 
filter to remove not 
only the impurities 
but also to kill the harmful germs in 
water using UV rays.
Reverse Osmosis (RO) is a process 
of removing impurities from water to 
make it potable.

 Different separation methods are 
adopted depending 
on the properties 
of the components.
  Handpicking – Particles reasonably 
large in size to be recognised can be 
picked by handpicking.
  Winnowing – Adopted to separate 
lighter solids from heavier ones.
  Magnetic separation – Separating 
magnetic substances from  
non-magnetic substances.
  Sedimentation – Settling down of 
suspended, insoluble and heavy solid 
particles (used to separate solid – 
liquid mixtures).
  Decantation - Process of pouring out 
the clear supernatant liquid without

Introduction
Rani and Ravi went to vegetable 
ma
rket with their mother. They saw variety 
of fresh green vegetables with attractive 
colours. Their mother bought cauliflower, 
cabbage
 and raddish. Ravi asked his 
mother 'Mom, do all the vegetables grow 
under the
 soil?' His mother answered, 
"No Ravi, we get some vegetable from 
stem, some from
 roots. Even some flowers 
are used for cooking". Rani and Ravi 
were surprised to know that vegetables 
are from different parts of the plant. 
After returning home
 they sorted out all 
vegetables from the bag and discussed 
which vegetable is from
 stem, which is from 
root and which is from flower . Their mother 
collected keezhanelli, curry leaves, and 
coriander leaves
 from the garden and said 
that the purpose of using these leaves 
in cooking is to add
 medicinal value and 
aroma.  Discuss with your teacher about 
the pictures given below.
The living world comprises of plants 
and animals. Plants can prepare food by 
themselves, grow in size, and reproduce. 
Various parts of the plants are used as
 
food, medicine, wood, and shelter.
4.1 Plant forms and functions
Our body is made up of many organs. 
Similarly the plant 
body is also made up of 
several organs such as root, stem, leaves 
and flowers . Plants are of many forms 
and many colours, yet they  are alike in 
some manner. That is, they all have stems 
and leaves above the ground which we can 
see easily and roots below the ground.
As shown in the picture, a flowering 
plant consists of two main parts. They are,
1. Root system.
2. Shoot system
Let us learn about them in detail.

Shoot System
1. Root System
The underground part of the main axis 
of a plant is known as root. It lies below the
 
surface of the soil. Root has no nodes and 
internodes. It has a root cap at the tip. A tuft 
of root hairs is found just above the root tip. 
Roots are positively geotropic in nature
Biology is a natural science concerned 
wi
th the study of life and living organisms, 
including  their structure and functions. 
6th Science_EM_Unit 4.indd   56 12-11-2022   11:02:51
57
Functions of the Root
 Fix
es the plant to the soil.
 Absorbs water and minerals from the 
soil.
 Some plants like carrot and beet root 
store food in root.
Guess it
Is it a root or stem?
2. Shoot system 
The aerial part of the plant body above 
the gr
ound is known as the shoot system. 
Main axis of the shoot system is called the 
stem. The shoot system consists of stem,
 
leaves, flowers and fruits. 
Root system is classified into two types.
a. Taproot system
b. Fibrous root system
a. Taproot system
It consists of a single root, called 
tap
root, which grows straight down into 
the ground. Smaller roots, called lateral 
roots arise from the taproot. They are 
seen in dicotyledonous plants.
Example: Bean, Mango, Neem.
b. Fibrous root system
It consists of a cluster of roots arising 
fr
om the base of the stem. They are thin 
and uniform in size. It is generally seen in 
monocotyledonous plants.
Example: Grass, Paddy, Maize.
Fibrous Root of Grass
Activity 1
Water absorption by Root
Aim: T
o observe absorption of water 
by root.
What you need? A carrot, a glass of 
water and blue ink.
What to do? Place a carrot in a glass 
of water  with  a  few  drops  of  blue  
ink. Leave the carrot in water for two  
to three days. Then cut the carrot 
into half length wise and observe.
What do you learn?  Blue colour 
appears in carrot which indicates the 
upward movement of water in the carrot 
showing that root conducts water.
6th Science_EM_Unit 4.indd   57 12-11-2022   11:02:51
58
Functions of the stem
 Supports the branches, leaves, flowers 
and f
ruits.
 Transports water and minerals from roots 
to upper aerial parts of the plant.
 Transports the prepared food from leaves 
to other parts through stem.
 Stores food as in the case of sugarcane.
Leaf
The leaf is a green, flat expanded 
structur
e borne on the stem at the node.
A leaf has a stalk called petiole. 
The flat portion of the leaf is cal
led leaf 
lamina or leaf blade . On the lamina, 
there is a main vein called midrib . Other 
veins are  branched out from mid rib. The 
portion of the leaf connected in the nodal 
region of the  stem is known as the  leaf 
base. Leaves of some plants possess a 
pair of lateral  outgrowth on the base, 
on either side of axillary bud. These are 
called stipules.
The green colour of the leaf is due to 
the presence of green coloured pigment 
called chlorophyll. On the lower side of the 
leaf there are tiny pores or openings known 
as stomata.
Functions of the Leaves
 The green leaves pr epare food by 
photosynthesis.
 They help in respiration.
 They carry out transpiration.
Stem
Stem grows above the soil, and it grows 
tow
ards the sunlight.  It has nodes and 
internodes. Nodes are the parts of stem, 
where leaf arises. The part of the stem between 
two successive nodes is called internode. 
The bud at the tip of the stem is known as 
apical or terminal bud, and the buds at the 
axils of the leaves are called axillary buds.
Activity 2
Conduction of water
Aim: T
o observe conduction of water 
by stem.
What you need? A small twig of 
 balsam plant, a glass of water and a 
few drops of red ink.
What to do? Place the small twig in 
the water with red ink. 
What do you see? The stem  becomes 
reddish.
What do you learn? This is because 
red coloured water is being absorbed 
by the stem upwards.

The leaves of Victoria  
amazonica plant 
grows upto 3 metres 
across. A mature  
Victoria leaf can support an evenly 
distributed load of 45 Kilograms  or 
apparently young person.
Activity 3
The teacher has to divide students 
into f
our groups. Each group leader 
will get a paper having the plant part 
(roots, stems, leaves, and flower) 
written on it, from the teacher. The 
teacher will take students around the 
campus to search for their assigned 
plant parts. They have to locate 
different types of plants discussed 
in the class room. The students 
will return to the class and discuss 
among themselves to create a poster. 
For example, flower group will create 
a poster by identifying correctly each 
part of the flower. Each group will 
share their posters within the class.
Think to learn
How do we classify the plants?
1. B
ased on flower, plants can be classified 
into two main groups. They are: 
Flowering plants and Non-flowering 
plants.
2. Based on the presence of seed coat, 
plants can be divided into two groups. 
Angiosperms (Seeds are enclosed 
within a fruit) and Gymnosperms 
(Seeds are not enclosed within a fruit)
Sun Flower 
(Flowering plant)
Ric cia  
(Non-Flowering plant)
Mango (Angiosperm)
 Cycas (Gymnosperm)
Activity 4 
Read the following story along 
with your friend
Once,  I w
as a happy monkey. I lived in 
a beautiful thick forest with my mother 
and two brothers. We ran and played 
in the  lush grass. On one hot day, I 
fell fast asleep in the cool shade of a  
tree. Suddenly the bright sun woke 
me up. I opened my eyes and could 
not believe what I saw. Everything 
has changed. Everything had been 
destroyed. I stood and looked at the 
stumps that used to be trees. Nothing 
was left apart from hard dry ground 
and only streets and building. I saw 
a deer that looked very sad. 'Where 
have all the trees gone and where are 
all the
 other animals?' I asked her.
4.2. Habitat

Types of Habitats
Let us study the two major types of 
habi
tats.
I.  Aquatic habitat
When we visit a pond, we see some 
plants appear to float on water. One of 
the common plants is the Lotus plant. Its 
leaves float on the water. There is a small 
frog
 sitting on a leaf. It is ready to catch 
the insects flying / fluttering around the 
flowers. The
 stem of the plant is seen to be 
inside (submerged) the water. Its roots are 
found within the
 muddy floor of the pond. 
As this plant grows in water, shall we call it 
an aquatic plant?
Aquatic habitat includes areas that 
ar
e permanently covered by water and 
surrounding areas that are occasionally 
covered by water. There are two types of 
habitat
 namely fresh water habitat and 
marine water habitat.
She explained how humans had 
chopped down 
all the trees, but had 
not planted new ones to replace them. 
After a while, I said good bye to the 
deer. My home
 is gone. I didn’t know 
where my family is, and I was hungry 
and thirsty,
 day and night. I walked in 
search of water, food and safe place 
to sleep. Whenever I stopped
 to rest, 
humans drove me away with sticks 
and angry voices. I could feel my 
body getting weak
 and tired. One day 
when I had almost given all the hope, 
I came across a cool and dark forest. 
As I walked through it, I found plenty 
of food and water. The forest was safe 
for me. There
 were no signs of human 
visiting it.
 Why did the deer feel sad?
 Who chopped the trees?
 Which is the safest place for monkey 
to live?
What is a habitat? Each and every 
organism 
needs a place to live and 
reproduce. Such a dwelling place is called 
habitat. From the depths of the ocean to 
the top of the highest mountain, habitats 
are the places where plants and animals live.

rform about 40% of all photo synthesis 
that occurs on the planet.
Example: Marine algae, Sea grasses, 
Marsh grass, Phytoplanktons.
•  Nile is the longest 
riv
er in the world. It 
is 6650 Km long. 
•  The Longest river in 
India is Ganges. It is 
2525 Km long.
II. Terrestrial habitat
Terr
estrial habitats are the ones that 
are found on land like forest, grassland 
and desert. It also includes man-made 
habitats like farms, towns and cities. 
They can be as big as a continent or as 
small as an island. They make up about 
28% of the entire world habitat.
Example: Evergreen forest, scrub jungles.
Terrestrial habitat is classified into 
thr
ee types. They are:
a. Forest  b. Grass land  c. Desert 
a. Fresh water Habitat
Rivers, lakes, ponds and pools are the 
fresh water habitats. Water hyacinth, water 
lily and lotus are seen in the fresh water 
habitat. In these plants roots are very
 much 
reduced in size. Stem and leaves have air 
chambers that allow aquatic plants to float 
in water.
Air spaces in stems 
and petioles 
of lotus 
are useful for floating 
in water
b. Marine water habitat
Fr
om outer space Earth looks like 
an awesome blue  marble, that’s because 
more than 70% of Earth’s surface is 
covered by oceans. Oceans also supports 
the growth of plants. M
arine plants 
 The first land plant 
appear
ed around 470 
million years ago. 
They were mosses and 
liverworts.
The Amazon Rain Forest in South 
America produces half of the world’s 
oxygen supply.

deep in the soil in search of water. Types of 
desert habi
tat include: 
  (i) Hot dry deserts 
 (ii) Semi arid deserts 
(iii) Coastal deserts 
(iv) Cold deserts. 
Example: Cactus, Agave, Aloe, 
Bryophyllum
Fact file
Thar Desert, also called Great Indian 
Desert, is an arid r
egion of rolling 
sand hills on the Indian subcontinent. 
It is located partly in Rajasthan state, 
north-western India, and partly in 
Punjab and Sindh (Sind) provinces, 
Eastern Pakistan.

Visit a nearby nursery. Choose any 
ten v
arieties of plants and place them 
under the appropriate habitats.
4.3 Plant Adaptations and  
  Modifications
Adaptations are special features in 
plants which help them to surviv
e in the 
habitats they live over a long period. Plants 
in a specific environment have developed 
special features
 which help them to grow 
and live in that particular habitat. In 
this section, Let us study about some
 
adaptations like tendrils, twiners and thorns. 
a. Forest habitat
Forest is a large area dominated by 
trees. There are three types of forests. They 
 are: Tropical forests, Temperate forests 
and Mountain forests. Annual rain fall here 
ranges from 25 - 200 cm.
 b. Grass land habitat 
Gr
assland is an area where the 
 vegetation is dominated by grasses. 
 Grasses range from short to tall. 
Example: Savanna Grassland
c. Desert habitat 
A habi
tat without much water is called 
deserts. Deserts are the driest place on 
earth. They get less than 25cm of rainfall 
annually. Deserts cover atleast 20% of the 
Earth. The plants which grow in this habitat 
have thick leaves that store water and 
minerals. The plants like cactus store water 
in their stem and the leaves are reduced to 
spines. They have long roots that go very 
World habitat day

ed on 1 st 
Monday of October 
every year.

3. Thorns
Lea
ves of some plants become wholly 
or partially modified into sharp pointed 
structures called 'thorns or spines' for 
defensive purpose.
Example: 
a. Agave - The leaf apex and margins are 
modified into thorns.
 
b. Opuntia - The leaves are modified into 
spines.
c. Bougainvillea – The stem has sharp 
thorns.

Plant types to be observed:
1. A tendril climber
2. A twiner
3. A plant with thorn
Tabulate the modification that you 
have observed in these plants
These adaptations are seen in plants which 
liv
e in terrestrial and desert habitats.
1. Tendril Climbers
Tendril is a twining climbing organ of 
some weak stemmed plants like peas and 
bitter gourd. Tendril coils round a support 
and helps the plant to climb. 
Examples:
a.  Sweet Peas (Lathyrus) - Leaflets ar e 
modified into tendrils. 
b.  Bitter Gourd - Axillary buds are modified 
into tendrils which help the plant to climb.
Lathyrus 
Bamboo  is  one  of 
the  f
ast growing 
plants,  during active 
growth phase.
2. Twiners
S
ome plants have weak stems. They 
cannot stand straight on their own. They 
must climb on any support to survive.
Example: Clitoria and Jasmine

 Leaves perform three major  functions 
such 
as
 1. Photosynthesis
 2. Respiration
 3. Transpiration
 The surroundings where plants live are 
called their habitat
 The two major habitats are: 
 1. Aquatic habitat 
 2. Terrestrial habitat 
 Adaptations are special features in 
plants which help them to survive in 
their habitat.
 Tendril is a climbing organ of some 
weak stemmed plants.
 Twiners have weak stem and they can 
not stand straight on their own.
HOTS
Cactus plant is green in colour and 
perf
orms photosynthesis. Which part 
of this plant does photosynthesis?
Points  to Remember
 The plant body of flowering plant 
consists of two 
main parts. They are: 
 1. Root system
 2. Shoot system
 Roots fix the plants to the soil. Roots 
absorb water and minerals from the 
soil.
 Stem is the ascending part of 
the plant axis. It has nodes and 
internodes.

Habitat
Fishes and crabs live only in water 
while man
y animals like elephants, tigers 
and camels live on land. The geographical 
features and environmental conditions on 
earth differ from one place to another. 
Though camel can live anywhere it is able 
to live in deserts more comfortably. Polar 
bear and penguins dwell in cold regions. 
Living in such harsh conditions requires 
special features in these animals. They 
help these organisms to live, breed and 
excel well in that particular place. Living or 
dwelling place of an organism is known as 
habitat.
Activity 1 
Look at the picture given below and  
pr
epare a chart  for the following 
interpretation.
 How does the climate differ in 
these habitats?
 Name some animals that exist in 
these habitats.
 Can an animal survive if it is 
shifted from one habitat to 
another contrasting habitat?
Introduction
The National  School,  Nallur, organised 
a field trip to a nearb
y village called 
Anaikkadu. The students were so happy 
to see a village with ponds, streams, green 
fields and coconut trees. With the help of their 
teacher students were allowed to go around. 
One of them saw two birds building a nest. 
Where do the birds build nests and why?
Children saw a number of butterflies 
fluttering near the flowers.  The air was so 
fresh, so calm, so quiet and so relaxing. 
They came across a pond in the distance. 
It had some water. Floating on the water 
were dark green lotus leaves. A green frog 
was leaping from one lotus leaf to another 
making a croaking sound. A girl spotted a 
rabbit with a short tail. 
Can you make a list of the animals 
seen by the children? Were they all similar? 
In what way they were similar?
5.1 Biodiversity
In the living world, a lot of diversity is 
seen both in animals and plants. Ev
ery plant 
and animal is unique. It is called biodiversity. 
Biodiversity may be defined as the variety 
and variability among living organisms and 
the habitats in which they live.
Biodiversity includes a variety of 
ecosystems such as those that occur in 
deserts, forests, mountains, lakes, rivers 
and agricultural fields. In each ecosystem, 
living creatures, including humans, form a 
community interacting with one another 
and with other animals, plants, air, water 
and soil around them. The living things 
form biotic community and non-living 
things form abiotic community.

1. Unicellular organism
Unicellular organisms are small, 
usual
ly microscopic. They cannot 
be seen with naked eye. They are 
aquatic, simplest and most primitive 
of all animals. They perform all their 
physiological activities by the special 
structures present inside the body 
called organelles.
Amoeba 
We know Amoeba is an unicellular 
organism. It does al
l the activities like 
digestion, locomotion, respiration and 
reproduction within the same cell.
It swallows food from the water and 
the food is digested in the food vacuole. 
Contractile vacuoles help in excretion. 
Respiration is by simple diffusion through 
the body surface. They have finger-
like projections called pseudopodia, 
(false foot) which help in movement or 
locomotion.
Paramecium
Paramecium is also a unicellular 
organism which liv
es in water and moves 
with the help of cilia.
Activity 2
Collect the pictures of  various ecosystems 
lik
e lakes, ponds, forests, deserts, 
mountains, and polar regions and prepare 
a chart of animals living in these places.
In Jurong Birds Park, 
Singapor

are kept in a big glass 
case with ice bergs 
and the temperature is maintained 
at 0° C and below.

5.2  Unicellular and  
Multicellular Organisms
Living things are made of small units 
cal
led cells. All the functions and processes 
in the body of living things are brought about 
with the help of these microscopic cells. 
Some organisms are made of a single cell 
and these are called unicellular organisms; 
whereas, the organisms that are made 
of many cells are called multicellular 
organisms .
Amoeba, paramecium and euglena 
are unicellular organisms while fish, frog, 
lizard, bird and man are multicellular 
organisms.

Euglena
Euglena is an unicellular animal which 
mo
ves with a flagellum.
2. Multicellular organisms
Majority of organisms 
we see ar
ound us, 
including animals are 
multicellular. In such 
organisms, different 
functions are carried out 
by different groups of cells or organs in 
their body. E.g. Jelly fish, Earth worm, 
snails, fish, frog, snakes, pigeon, tiger, 
monkey and man.
Table 1 The differences between Unicellular and Multicellular Organisms.
Unicellular Organism Multicellular Organism
 They are made up of a single cell.
 They can perform all the functions  
of li
fe.
 These organisms are generally very 
smal
l (microscopic) in size. 
 They lack tissues, organs and organ 
 systems.

 Growth occurs by an increase in the 
siz
e of the cells.
 Eg. Amoeba, Paramecium and Euglena.
 They are organisms that are made up of 
man
y cells.
 Division of labour exists among cells. 
Di
fferent cells are specialized to perform 
different functions.
 They are mostly large in size. They are 
seen thr
ough naked eye.
 They are composed of tissues, organs 
and or
gan systems.
 Growth occurs by an increase in the 
number of cel
ls by cell division.
 Eg. Earthworm, Fish, Frog, Lizard and 
human being.

5.3 Adatptation in  Animals
A Living thing can survive in a 
particular 
habitat if its body is adapted to 
the conditions of that habitat. Plants and 
animals develop special characteristics or 
features in their body in order to survive 
in their habitat (the surroundings). The 
presence of specific body features for 
certain habitats which enable a plant or 
an animal to live in a particular habitat is 
called adaptation.
The fish live either in freshwater or in 
marine water. Let us analyse the adaptations 
seen in fishes for their aquatic life.
Fish
1. The head, trunk and tail of a fish merge 
to f
orm a streamlined shape. The 
streamlined body shape helps the fish to 
move through the water easily.
2. The fish has special organ called 'gills'. 
It is a respiratory organ which helps to 
absorb oxygen dissolved in water for 
breathing. It is adapted to breathe in 
water.
3. Most of the fishes have slippery 
scales all over the body which protect 
the body.
4. The fish has fins for fast swimming.
5. The fish has strong tail fin which acts 
as rudder to change dir
ection and 
keep its body balance in water.
Frog
Amphibians lead a dual mode of life, 
living 
both in water and land. They are 
poikilothermic animals.  Their body is 
divided into head and trunk with two pairs 
of limbs. During the larval stage, frog 
respire with the help of gills and the adult 
frog respire through skin, lungs and bucco-
pharyngeal region.
Lizard
1.  Lizards are scaly-skinned reptiles that 
ar
e usually distinguished from snakes 
by the possession of legs, movable 
eyelids, and external ear openings.
2.  They mostly inhabit warm regions. Most 
lizards are quadripedal (walk with four 
legs) and have a powerful limb.
3.  Some lizards are able to run bipedally 
with two legs. In these lizards, the tail 
is held out backward and upward and 
acts as a counterweight. 
4.  Some lizards have the capacity to rotate 
the head around the head joint.
5.  They breathe through lungs. 
6th Science_EM_Unit 5.indd   73 12-11-2022   11:06:56
74
Animals change their 
location as the season
 
changes. It is called 
migration . In Tamil 
Nadu bird sanctuaries are located at 
Vedanthangal, Kodiyakkarai  and 
Koondhankulam. Many birds from 
foreign countries like Siberia and 
Russia migrate to Vedanthaangal.  
Likewise during summer and drought 
conditions birds from our country 
migrate to foreign countries.  These 
birds are called migratory birds .
6  Most lizards eat a variety of insects 
lik
e mosquitoes and cockroaches 
with sharp projections on the tongue 
adapted for grabbing and holding.
7  Some lizards (Dinosaurs) have web in 
the toes, and few lizards are able to 
glide or parachute the air and make 
safe landings. 
Birds
1.  They have streamlined body covered 
wi
th feathers. This body shape 
provides minimum resistance to air.
2 They have beak instead of mouth.
3.  They breathe through lungs.
4. They have a pair of wings that are  
 modified forelimbs.
5.  They have hollow and light bones. 
6.  Usually we see birds fly, however they 
can also hop, move, run, etc., on the 
ground and they perch well on the 
branches of tree with the help of a 
pair of clawed feet.
7.  The tail of the bird helps it to control 
the direction of the movements.
8.  They have strong chest muscles which 
help them withstand the pressure 
of the air while flapping their wings 
during flight.
9.  At a time, birds can see one object 
with one eye and another object with 
the other eye (Binocular vision).

Camel
Camel lives in hot desert where 
water is 
scarce. Camel is able to survive 
in desert because of the following special 
features.
1. The camel has long legs which help 
it to keep its body away from the hot 
sand in the desert.
2. A camel can drink large amount of 
water (when it is available) and store 
it in the body.
3. A camel’s body is adapted to save 
water in the dry desert in the following 
ways: 
 (i)     A Camel passes small amount of 
urine
 (ii)   Its dung is dry and it does not 
sweat. 
 (iii)  Since a camel loses very little 
water from its body, it can live 
for many days without drinking 
water.
4. A camel’s hump has fat stored in 
it. In case of energy requirement a 
camel can break down stored fat for 
nourishment.
5. A camel has large and flat padded 
feet 
which help it to walk easily on 
soft sand. Thus it is called 'Ship of 
the desert'.
6. Camel has long eye lashes and hairs 
to protect its eyes and ears from the 
blowing dust.
7. It can keep its nostrils closed to 
avoid dust during sand storms in the 
deserts.
Info Bits 
Spending winters in a dormant condition is called hibernation (Winter sleep).  
Eg. Turtle
On the other hand, spending the hot and dry period in an inactive state is known as 
aestivation (Summer sleep). Eg. Snail

Introduction
The word 'health' refers to a state 
of complete emotional 
and physical well-
being. Healthcare exists to help people 
maintain this optimal state of health.
As defined by World Health 
Organization (WHO), 'health is a state 
of complete physical, mental, and social 
well being, and not merely the absence of 
disease or infirmity'. Health is a dynamic 
condition resulting from a body's constant 
adjustment and adaptation in response to 
stresses and changes in the environment 
for maintaining an inner equilibrium called 
homeostasis.
Hygiene is a science of  establishment 
and maintenance of health conditions or 
practices (as of cleanliness) conducive to 
health. Brushing your teeth regularly is 
an important part of good oral hygiene.  
Hygiene is defined as the practice of 
keeping yourself and your surroundings 
clean, in order to prevent illness or the 
spread of diseases.

esence of  Fat in the given 
food item.
What do you need?
Coconut oil, groundnut oil, and  any 
paper.
How to do?
Pour few drops of oil onto the  paper 
and rub it gently with your finger.
In case of ground nut, crush the 
groundnut and place it on a  paper. 
Now rub the groundnut on the paper.
What do you see?
The paper turns translucent and  
becomes greasy.
What do you learn?
The given food sample contains fat.
 Whole grains 
Fats
Fat is also an energy-giving food 
and i
t provides more energy than 
Carbohydrates. Some important sources 
of fats are butter, ghee, milk, cheese, 
paneer, nuts, meat, fish, egg yolk etc. 
Apart from giving energy, they insulate 
our body and protect the cells.
Activity 3
Aim:
To test the pr
esence of Carbohydrate 
as Starch in the given food item.
What do you need?
Boiled potato, dropper and dilute 
Iodine solution
How to do?
Smash the boiled potato.
Add two or three drops of dilute 
Iodine solution on the sample
What do you observe?
The potato turns blue-black in colour.
What do you infer?
Iodine reacts with starch to form 
Starch-Iodine complex which is blue-
black in colour. Thus, the appearance 
of  blue-black colour confirms the 
presence of starch in the food item

Vitamins
Vitamins are required for carrying 
out v
arious biochemical reactions in our 
body. Fruits, vegetables, grains and meat 
products are good sources of vitamins. 
Vitamins are called as protective food. 
There are six major vitamins like A, B, C, 
D, E and K. Vitamin B and Vitamin C are 
water soluble. Vitamins A, D, E and K are 
fat soluble.
Protein
Proteins are necessary for our growth 
as 
well as for regulating various body 
functions such as digestion. The sources 
of proteins are pulses, eggs, fish, milk, 
chicken, soya bean, nut, grams etc, 
Proteins are body building foods.
Sprouted pulses

Health is a state of complete physical, 
mental and 
social well-being and not merely 
absence of diseases. Eating a healthy diet 
keeps you physically and mentally fit. 
When you are physically healthy, you feel 
confident, you are more outgoing and have 
a greater capacity for enjoying life.
Unhealthy food choices lead to 
obesity and illness, preventing you from 
socializing with friends and family. So 
choose your diet carefully.
Balanced Diet
A diet should contain adequate 
amount of al
l the necessary nutrients 
required for healthy growth and activity.
6.2 Health and Nutrients
Look at the pictures given below. Mark 9  for healthy persons and mark   for 
unheal
thy persons.
Food Pyramid
A balanced diet contains suf
ficient 
amount of various nutrients to ensure 
good health. Balanced diet is important 
for the following reasons.
• It increases the capacity to work.
• It gives good physical and mental 
health.
• It increases the capacity to resist 
diseases.
• It helps in proper growth of the body.
Activity 7
Prepare a diet chart to provide 
balanced diet to a 12 y
ear old boy/girl. 
The diet chart should include food 
item which are not expensive and are 
commonly available in your area.
Malnutrition
When your diet is not balanced, what 
would be the consequence? Observ

These children do not have normal 
heal
th  because of malnutrition.
Malnutrition occurs when all the 
nutrients that the body needs are not 
obtained in the proper proportions from 
the diet. The word malnutrition refers 
to the condition that results when a 
person does not take a balanced diet. 
Malnutrition leads to deficiency diseases. 
The diseases that are caused due to 
lack of nutrients in the diet are called 
deficiency diseases.
India has the second 
lar
gest number of 
obese children in the 
world after China. 
According to a study it 
has been found that 14.4 million children 
in the country have excess weight.

such personal habit choices as how 
fr
equently we bathe, wash hands, trim 
fingernails, and change clothing. It also 
includes attention to keep surfaces in the 
home and workplace, including bathroom 
facilities, clean and pathogen-free.
• developing athletic skills, weight loss 
or maintenance, and enjoyment. 
Physical exercise may help to 
decrease some of the effects of childhood 
and adult obesity.
Rest
Proper amount of rest is essential 
for ph
ysical and mental health. Rest is 
as important as nutrition and physical 
activity for growth and development and 
good health.

Personal Cleanliness
Hygiene is a set  
of practices performed 
to preserve health. 
According to the World 
Health Organization 
(WHO), “hygiene refers 
to conditions and practices that help to 
maintain health and prevent the spread 
of diseases”.
Personal hygiene involves those 
practices performed by an individual 
to care for one’s bodily health and well 
being, through cleanliness. It includes 
One day Rahim, a class six boy 
vomi
ted three times. He was looking 
tired and dehydrated. His mother 
who is working as a nurse prepared 
a solution and gave it to him to drink. 
He felt better after sometime and 
asked his mother what the solution 
was. His mother told that it is Oral 
Rehydration Solution (ORS). Shall 
we know what an ORS is?
Vomiting or loose motions result 
in loss of water and cause salt 
imbalance in the body. Loss of water 
(dehydration) can lead to serious 
problems. This can be prevented by 
consuming ORS at short intervals. 
Follow the steps to make ORS at 
home. 
• Take a litre of boiled water and 
cool it.
• Add half a teaspoon of salt and six 
teaspoons of sugar to it.
• You can also add a few drops 
of lemon juice to it. Stir it and 
give it to the person suffering 
from vomiting, loose motion or 
dehydration.

Bacteria 
Bacteria are very small prokaryotic 
micr
oorganisms. Bacterial cells do not 
have nucleus and do not usually have 
membrane bound organelles.
•  Bacteria can exist either as independent 
organisms or as parasites.
• They invade tissues.
• They produce pus or harmful wastes.
Table 6 Personal Hygiene and Frequency of Cleanliness
Components Recommended frequency of cleaning
Ey
e hygiene Every morning and whenever the face is dirty.
Hair hygiene Weekly twice preferably once in every other day.
Body hygiene Once or twice a day.
Oral hygiene Brushing twice a day. Rinsing after each meal.
Feet hygiene Every day
Hand hygiene Every time after touching contaminated surfaces.  
Every time before eating and touching clean surfaces.
Clothe hygiene Once or twice a day.
6.3 Introduction to Microbes 
When you neglect personal hygiene, 
you ar
e increasing the risk of falling sick.
Let us name some of the diseases or 
conditions caused by microorganism due 
to the negligence of personal hygiene.
1. Diarrhoea  2. Tooth decay
3. Athlete’s foot (Madurai’s foot)
4. Dandruff.
Do you believe that there are some 
organisms which you cannot see with 
your naked eye? Yes. microbes can not 
be seen without the help of a microscope.
Most of the microbes belong to four 
major groups.
• Bacteria
• Virus
• Protozoa
• fungi

Virus 
Virus is an infective agent that typically 
consist of nucleic acid molecule in a pr
otein 
coat. It replicates only inside the cells of 
other living organisms. Virus can infect all 
types of life forms like plant, animals and 
microorganisms. They invade living normal 
cells and use their cell machinery to multiply. 
They can kill, damage or change the cells 
and make you sick.

(Boys and girls of st andard VI are
 
playing in the playground).
Siva: Hey Salim, I saw your father coming 
with a big parcel yesterday. I guess you 
could have bought a new television. Am 
I right?
Salim: It’s not a television Siva. We 
bought a new computer.
Malar: Oh, I see. computer! I had seen 
it used in textile shop for billing.
Selvi: Malar, not only it is used in textile 
shops, but also in railway stations, banks, 
ATM’s and in many places. It is used even 
in our local post offices.
Nancy: Hey! I have seen it in my school.
Salim: Is it only in your school? Nancy, 
I think your father is also having a 
computer.
Nancy: Is my father having a computer?! 
Without my knowledge? I am sure that 
my father does not have computer. He 
has only a mobile phone.
Salim: That’s what I say. Your father’s 
mobile phone is also like a computer.
Nancy: Oh no Salim? What do you mean? 
How can a mobile phone be compared 
with a computer?
Salim: Nancy, we usually think that 
computer 
should be like a big TV and a box 
attached with it. But computers are available 
in different shapes. The works which are 
done with a computer can also be done using 
a smart phone. There may be difference in 
their speed, but their operations remain the 
same. The big computers are shrunk into 
small smart phones nowadays because of 
the technological development. Most of us 
think that smart phones are only to make 
calls because of its handy look But it is not so. 
Selvi: What about laptops and tablets?  
Are they same like the computers we 
usually think of?
Salim: Yes, they are all the same. There 
are different types of computers. But 
their performance vary according to their 
capacity.
Siva: That’s ok Salim, why do you need 
a computer in your home? What will you 
do in that?
Salim: I can use it to draw, paint, play 
games and I can learn and develop my 
general knowledge.
Selvi: Salim, you know more about 
computers!
Salim: I know very little about computers. 
As my father uses computer in his office, 
he knows much about it. I shared very 
little of what I have learnt from my father.

Later, 
they started using a device called 
calculator for calculation. 
Selvi: Wow! It’s really interesting sir. 
Then, when did computers come into use 
Sir?
Teacher: Good question Selvi. Computer 
didn’t come directly from abacus. The 
computers that we use today belongs to 
fifth generation.
Nancy: Oh! Were there four more 
generations previous to this?
Teacher: Yes Nancy, you are correct.
Siva: Sir! Can you explain us about the 
five generations? 
Teacher: Sure, I can explain. 
• In the First generation computers,  
Vacuum tube was used.
• In the Second generation computers, 
they used Transistor.
• In the Third generation computers, 
they used Integrated Circuits.
• In the Fourth generation computers, 
they used Micro processor.
• In the Fifth generation computers  
Artificial Intelligence is used.
Selvi: Sir, we are eager to know more 
about the present computers which 
we use. 
Teacher: Data and information are the 
two important elements in computers.
Malar: Sir, what is meant by data?
Teacher: Data is the information that 
has to be processed. It cannot be used 
Teacher: What is going on?
Children: We are discussing about the 
computer sir.
Teacher: Oh, I see, that’s nice. I will 
explain about computers in detail. Firstly 
I will explain you, what is a computer? 
Computer is an electronic device that 
processes the data and Information 
according to our needs. We can save 
the data and convert it into information. 
Computers are used in many ways.
Malar: We are eager to know who 
invented the computer.
Teacher: In the beginning of the 19th century, 
Charles Babbage, a professor in Mathematics 
designed an analogue computer. He is 
known as the father of computer.
The basic structure designed by him 
is being used in all computers. Similarly, 
Augusta Ada Lovelace is admired as the 
first programmer as she developed essential 
commands for the mathematical operations.
Nancy: Sir, can you tell us which device 
w
as used before the invention of 
computer?
Teacher: In the early 
stage, there was no 
computer. Initially the 
people used a tool called 
abacus for calculations.

progr
am. For example, the software 
used for painting, playing games in 
computer.
Nancy: Oh! I have learnt much 
information about computers today sir!.
Malar: Ok Sir, then what is hardware?
Teacher: The parts that are available in 
the computer that helps the software to 
work is a hardware.
Salim: Sir, please tell us more about it 
Teacher: Yes, sure I will. Whatever 
we want to send to a computer is sent 
through a device called input device. For 
example, the keyboard, mouse and other 
input devices. 
The data or information that has 
been sent to the computer are displayed 
out or reproduced through some devices. 
These are called as output devices. For 
example, printer, monitor and so on.
Nancy: Ok Sir, then what is CPU?
Teacher: It is the central processing 
unit. You will learn and understand more 
about CPU in your higher classes.
All Children together:  Thank you so 
much, sir. Today we have learnt and 
understood more information about 
computers.
directly by us. Generally, they are in 
the form of numbers, alphabet and 
images.
Siva: Sir… then what is information?
Teacher: Information is a form of 
processed data.
Siva: What is software and hardware, Sir?
Teacher: The commands or programs 
that are used in computer are called 
software. This software can be divided 
into two types.
1. Operating software
2. Application software.
Nancy: What is Operating Software?
Teacher: Software that is used to 
operate the computer is called operating 
software. I think you are familiar with 
Windows and Linux
Siva: Then, what is application software?
Teacher: Application software is a

Mother:  Yes, Your great grandpa’s name is 
Mr
. Ramasamy. OK. 
Often your father shows proudly a 
very old wooden pen and used to tell 
us that it was his grandpa’s pen. Do you 
remember it?
Tamilini: Yes, amma! Normally he keeps 
it in a beautiful wooden case on his table. 
Is that the one?
Mother: You are right, Tamilini. We cannot 
write with that pen now. But, father has kept 
it as a treasure. If you ask your father about 
that, he will show you the diary written by 
your great grandpa with that old pen. From 
that diary, we come to know that your great 
grandpa was a literate, while most of his 
villagers were illiterates. Further, we can 
understand the lifestyle of that period and 
also about activities from his diary writings.
Tamilini:  Can this small diary record so 
much of news, amma? 
Mother: Yes, Tamilini. We understand the 
period and lifestyles of people of Old Stone 
Age from used stone 
tools, like what you 
understand about your 
grandpa and his time 
from his diary writing.
History is the study 
of past 
events in 
chronological order.
Mother : What i s your name?
Tamilini : Tamilini.
Mother : Tell me your mother’s name.
Tamilini : Mrs. Sumathi.
Mother : Father’s name?
Tamilini : Mr. Adhiyaman.
Mother :  Tell me the name of your 
father’s father?
Tamilini :  You mean grandpa? 
Mr. Chidambaram.
Mother :  Do you know the name 
of great grandpa. Mr. 
Chidambaram’s father?
Tamilini :  Grandma always used to tell 
me about one ‘great grandpa’.
You want that great grandpa’s 
name, amma? mmm…
Info Bits
The term history has been derived 
fr
om the Greek word “ Istoria” which 
means ‘learning by enquiry’.
In ancient period, the people lived in caves, used to draw paintings in rocks called Rock 
Pai
nting. They might have wished to record their activities through these paintings.

Tamilini: What are the other sources that 
help us understand the lifestyles of Stone 
Age people?
Mother: We came to know their hunting 
style through their paintings on the rocks 
and the walls of the caves.
Tamilini: Rock paintings? It sounds really 
surprising. Why did they draw these paintings?
Mother: Some would have stayed back, 
without joining the hunting team. So for 
their benefit, these pictures could have 
been drawn. They might have done it as 
a part of their pastime. 
Tamilini: Certainly amma. That’s how we 
identify their lifestyles. Isn’t it, amma?
Mother: Well said, Tamilini. The period 
between the use of first stone tools and 
the invention of writing systems is pre-
history. Stone tools, excavated materials 
and rock paintings are the major sources 
of pre-history.

A Mighty  Emperor Ashoka
The most famous ruler of ancient India was Emperor Ashoka. It 
was 
during his period that Buddhism spread to different parts of 
Asia. Ashoka gave up war after seeing many people grieving death after the Kalinga 
war. He embraced Buddhism and then devoted his life to spread the message of peace 
and dharma. His service for the cause of public good was exemplary. He was the first 
ruler to give up war after victory. He was the first to build hospitals for animals. He 
was the first to lay roads. Ashoka Chakra with 24 spokes in our national flag was taken 
from the Sarnath Pillar of Ashoka.
Even though Emperor Ashoka was great, his greatness 
had been unknown until 19th century.The material evidence 
provided by William Jones, James Prinsep and Alexander 
Cunningham revealed the greatness of Emperor Ashoka.
Based on these accounts, Charles Allen wrote a book 
titled The Search for the India’s Lost Emperor, which 
provided a comprehensive account of Ashoka. Many 
researches made thereafter brought Ashoka’s glorious 
rule to light. These inscriptions were 
observed on the rocks, Sanchi Stupa and 
Sarnath Pillar and helped to understand 
the greatness of Ashoka to the world.

Now one can understand the 
importance of histori
cal research. But for 
the efforts of scholars, the greatness of 
Emperor Ashoka would not have come to 
light.
Mother :  Do you know what proto 
history is?
Tamilini :  That is the period between 
pre history and history.
Mother : Exactly. The period for which 
records in writing are available but not 
yet deciphered is called proto history. 
Today, we are leading a safe life with all 
modern equipment. But our ancestors did 
not live in such a safe environment. There 
might have been chances of wild animals 
entering their caves. But, they realised 
that dogs could help them to prevent 
the entry of such dangerous animals 
by its sniffing skill. Hence they started 
domesticating dogs for their protection 
and hunting activities.
From this, we also know how 
inscriptions, monuments, copper plates, 
accounts of foreigners or foreign 
travellers and folk tales play a vital role in 
constructing and reconstructing history.
Tamilini :  Now, I completely understand 
what history is, amma.
Thank you, amma.

Tamilini, a school student of Class VI, 
visi
ted a Science Centre accompanied by 
her grandmother. There they saw a time 
machine. The operator of the time machine 
explained the working of the machine.
Operator: If you press different buttons 
in the machine, it would take you to the 
chosen period of time. Why don’t you 
enjoy the experience of watching different 
periods of time using this machine? 
(After listening to the operator, both 
Tamilini and her grandmother were excited 
and decided to have the experience of 
the time machine.)
Tamilini:  Can we go forward and see 
how 2200 AD(CE) would be, grandma?
Grandma: What is so interesting about 
our future in 2200 AD(CE), Tamil? Let’s 
go backward and see how our past was 
like.
The story of human 
evol
ution can be 
scientifically studied 
with the help of 
archaeology and anthropology.
Tamilini:  You sound right, grandma.
Grandma pushed the button to 
1950 AD(CE). They saw mostly people 
walking, a few riding bicycles and buses 
appearing rarely on the roads. Slowly 
they moved back to 1850. There were 
no buses or cycles. Carts pulled by mules 
and bullocks were seen on the roads. 
Horse-drawn cart was a rare occurrence.
Tamilini then turned the button to 
8,000 years back. People were engaged in 
raising crops and livestock. She pushed the 
button to get a picture of

saw the humans living in 
caves. They were using 
tools made of stones 
and bones for hunting. 
Tamilini was frightened by the hunting 
scene and pushed the button forward to 
return to the present.
Grandma: Are y ou afraid, Tamil?
Grandma urged Tamilini to go further 
backward to see the ancient humans who 
lived with the apes. But Tamilini was not 
inclined. So both of them left the spot.
Tamilini:  Grandma, will you tell me the 
story of evolution of humans?
Grandma: Yes, certainly.
Grandma: Anthropologists have unearthed 
the footprints of humans in a country 
called Tanzania, which is in eastern 
Africa. They were found in rock 
beds submerged under the sand.

 Radio carbon dating was used to 
ascertain the peri
od. It was found out 
that the foot prints of humans they had 
discovered were about 3.5 millions years 
old. When there is sudden change in 
nature, the living beings adapt themselves 
to the changes and survive. Humans 
have thus evolved over millions of years 
adapting themselves to the changing 
times.

Anthropology i s the study of 
humans and evolutionary history.
The word anthropology is derived 
from two Greek words: anthropos 
meaning "man" or "human"; 
and logos, meaning "thought" or 
"reason." Anthropologists attempt, 
by investigating the whole range of 
human development and behavior, to 
achieve a total description of cultural 
and social phenomena.

Tamilini:  Grandma, wil l 
you explain it in detail?
Grandma: Human 
evolution means the 
process through which 
the humankind changes 
and develops towards an advanced stage 
of life. See how the modern human has 
evolved.
1. Humans in erect position and walking 
on two legs happened much later.
2. Changes in thumb so that they can 
hold things tightly.
3. Development of brain.
Homo sapiens who migrated out of 
eastern Africa settled in different parts of 
the world. Their lifestyle also evolved and 
they made it suitable to the environs in 
which they lived. So humans in different 
places adopted different forms of lifestyle. 
Based on the weather, climate and nature 
of the living place, their physique and 
complexion also differed. This resulted in 
the formation of different races. Human 
procreation resulted in an increase in the 
population.
Tamilini:  Grandma, it’s fantastic.
Grandma: Yes, it is. I shall now explain 
to you in detail how the Homo sapiens 
engaged in hunting and gathering.
Hunting and Food Gathering
Tamil, you will be surprised to know 
that millions of years ago, our ancestors led 
a nomadic life. They lived in groups in a cave 
or a mountain range. Each group consisted 
of 30 to 40 people. They kept on moving in 
search of food. They hunted pig, deer, bison, 
rhino, elephant and bear for food. They also 
ate the animals killed by other wild animals 
like tiger. They learnt the art of fishing. They 
collected honey from beehives, plucked fruits 
from the trees and dug out tubers from the 
ground. They also collected grains from the 
forest. Once the food resource got exhausted 
in one area, they moved to another place in 
search of food. They wore hides of animals 
and barks of trees and leaves for protecting 
their bodies during winter. So humans began 
hunting to satisfy their need for food.
Hunting Methods
1. Go as a group and hunt the prey. 2.  Dig a pit and trap the animals and hunt.

Why did humans become hunter-
gatherers? Did the l
andscape play 
any role?

Grandma: Tamilini, do you know the 
weapons that the early humans used for 
hunting?
Tamilini: I have no idea, grandma. Can 
you tell me about hunting practices?
Stone Tools and Weapons
Grandma: Hunting was the main 
occupation of humans in the past. It was 
difficult for humans to kill a big animal 
with a stick or a stone. So they decided 
to use sharpened weapons.
The best stone for the making weapons 
was 
chikki – mukki kal (flint). It is known 
for its strength and durability. Humans 
spent many hours in search of a flint stone. 
They made sharp weapons and tools with 
the help of the stones and fitted them with 
wood to grip them. Humans created tools 
like axes with big stones.
Tamilini: Why were axes made, grandma?
Grandma: The axes were made to cut 
trees, remove barks, dig pits, hunt 
animals and remove the skin of animals.
Grandma: Tamil, do you know what 
the next stage was after 
making stone tools?
Tamilini: I don’t know 
grandma. What would it be?
Grandma: Humans 
discovered the use of fire.
HOTS
Are there hunters in your area?
Why 
is hunting banned now?
Art of Flaking 
Keeping a stone in the bottom and 
sharpening i
t with another stone.
To make a stone tool, two stones were 
taken.One was used as a hammer to 
sharpen the other for removing flakes.

At first, humans were afraid of fire 
and li
ghtning. Probably fire caused by 
lightning had killed many wild animals. 
Humans tasted the flesh of the killed 
animals, which was soft and tasty. This 
made humans aware of the effect of fire. 
They used flint stone to make fire and 
used it to protect them from predators, 
for cooking food and for creating light 
during night. Thus fire became important 
for man in olden times.
HOTS
Is there any object that can bring heat 
and fir
e other than a match box?
Tamilini: What next, grandma?
Grandma:  You will be surprised to 
know that the next human invention was 
the wheel. This was the first scientific 
invention of humans using their brain and 
cognitive skills.
Invention of the Wheel
The invention of wheel by humans is 
consider
ed to be the foremost invention. 
When humans saw the stones rolling down 
from the mountains, probably they would 
have got the idea of making the wheel.
Pot Making
Humans learned to make pot with 
cla
y. The invention of wheel made pot 
making easier, and the pots made were 
burnt to make it stronger. They decorated 
pots with  lot of colours. The colour dyes 
were made from the extracts of roots, 
leaves or barks. These natural dyes were 
used in rock paintings.
Grandma:  Can you identify what is in 
this picture?
Hunting scene in which men and  
women ar
e taking part 
Tamilini:  Yeah. Some blurred tweaks are 
seen. Someone has drawn.
Grandma:  No, this is our ancestor’s 
handwork. In fact, it is the first art of 
humanity. Before the use of language, 
humans expressed their feelings through 
actions and also recorded it in rock 
paintings.
Even today in the 
vill
ages of Nilgiris 
district in Tamil Nadu, 
people have the habit 
of making fire without use of match box.

b. seeds that fall in the river beds sprout 
easil
y. 
c. plants grow faster in water fed areas. 
d. alluvial soil is more suitable for plant 
growth than any other.
With the above knowledge they 
gained, they realised that with proper 
sowing and nurturing, they could increase 
the number of plants more than the ones 
that grew naturally. Thus agriculture 
and farming came into existence. They 
domesticated the animals and used them 
in their farming.
Breeding of animals now became an 
important 
part of their life. Oxen were used 
for ploughing. Oxen made the practice 
of agriculture easier. Life was becoming 
organised than it was, when they were 
hunting. It enabled them to settle down 
in a place. Now with settlement came 
the problem of utensils and vessels for 
cooking and storage. The potter’s wheel 
and fire solved this problem.
The invention of plough helped the 
farming practices. Farming started with the 
clearing of land and burning the left-over 
shrubs. They ploughed the land, sowed 
seeds in them and harvested the produce. 
Ancient Rock Paintings
In India, we can see many paintings 
in rocks and caves. The rock paintings 
give some information about the past. 
Approximately there are 750 caves, in 
which 500 caves have paintings. There 
are many more undiscovered caves. The 
rock paintings depict hunting pictures of 
the male and the female, dancing pictures 
and pictures of children playing.
Tamilini:  Oh! We are able to gain some 
knowledge about the past lifestyle through 
these paintings. Isn’t it, Grandma?
Grandma: You said it rightly, Tamil. 
These rock and cave paintings tell us 
many stories about our ancestors.
Tamilini:  Okay, grandma! Now tell me 
how humans reached the next stage.
Grandma: There were many dangers 
involved in hunting. Due to large-scale 
hunting in the mountain areas and in the 
forests, many animals became extinct. 
Non availability of meat forced the humans 
to look for fruits and vegetables for food.
Tamilini: Now they would have thought 
of producing food for themselves. Is it 
not grandma?
From Nomadic to Settled Life : The 
World’s Earliest Farmers
Grandma:  Very well said, Tamil. The 
seed of fruits and the nuts they ate were 
thrown into the soil. During rains, the soil 
gave it life. Some days later, the saplings 
sprouted from the soil. By observation 
and logic, they learn that: 
a. a plant grows from a single seed and 
yields lots of fruits and vegetables.

During the pre historic period, humans lived in caves and depicted their daily events 
in dr
awings. Mostly pictures of animals were drawn.
Once the fertility of the soil decreased, 
they moved to a new place. Initially 
agriculture was done for immediate food 
requirement. Later when they found 
out ways to increase production, they 
started storing the produce. The food 
products stored were used during the lean 
harvest periods. By their experience, they 
understood that land close to the river side 
was suitable for farming. So they decided 
to stay there permanently.
Tamilini: How about domestication of 
animals, grandma?
Grandma: Humans thought of ways 
to better their skills at hunting.

They found out that the dogs could sniff  
other animals 
and chase them away. So 
humans found them useful for hunting. 
Thus dogs became the first animal to be 
domesticated by humans. Following the 
dogs, they started domesticating hen, 
goat and cow.
Tamilini:  What next?
Grandma: Humans stayed on the plains 
for a long time. During this period, they 
have not only learnt agriculture, but slowly 
developed skills of handicraft. Permanent 
settlement in a place increased the yield 
of crops. Now they had grains in excess 
of what they consumed. The surplus 
grains were exchanged with other 
groups for the other things they were in 
need of. This is called the barter system. 
Thus trade and commerce developed and 
towns and cities emerged.
Tamilini: Thank you, grandma. The 
information you have shared with me is 
very helpful, and I would share it with 
my friends at school tomorrow.
Grandma:  Very good. Congratulations 
Tamilini!

across some mysterious brick mounds. He 
wrote that he sa
w a “ruined brick castle with 
very high walls and towers built on a hill”. 
This was the earliest historical record of the 
existence of Harappa.
In 1856 
when engineers 
laid a railway 
line connecting 
Lahore to Karachi, 
they discovered 
more burnt 
bricks. Without 
understanding 
their significance, 
they used the 
bricks for laying the rail road.
In the 1920s archaeologists began to 
excavate the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-
Daro. They unearthed the remains of these 
long-forgotten cities. In 1924 the Director 
General of ASI, Sir John Marshall, found 
many common features between Harappa 
and Mohenjo-Daro. He concluded that they 
were part of a large civilisation.
Some slight differences are found 
in the earthenwares of Harappa and  
Mohenjo-Daro. This made the researchers 
conclude that Harappa was older than 
Mohenjo-Daro.
Initially, people lived in groups. Then they 
formed communities out of these groups. 
Then evolved the societies which in due 
course become civilisations.
Why did people settle near rivers?
People preferred to settle near the rivers for 
the reasons given below.
 ¾ The soil is fertile.
 ¾ Fresh water is available for drinking, 
watering livestock and irrigation.
 ¾ Easy movement of people and goods is 
possible.

Meher
garh is a Neolithic site. It is located near the Bolan Basin of Balochistan in 
Pakistan. It is one of the earliest sites known. It shows evidence of farming and 
herding done by man in very early times. Archaeological evidence suggests that 
Neolithic culture existed in Mehergarh as early as 7000 BC (BCE).

Bronze Age
It i
s a historical period characterised 
by the use of articles made of bronze.
 ¾ The streets are observed to have 
a grid pat
tern. They were straight 
running from north to south and east 
to west and intersected each other at 
right angles.
 ¾ The roads were wide with rounded 
corners.
 ¾ Houses were built on both sides of the 
street. The houses were either one or 
two storeys.
 ¾ Most of the houses had many rooms, 
a courtyard and a well. Each house 
had toilets and bathrooms.
 ¾ The houses were built using baked 
bricks and mortar. Sun-dried 
bricks were also used. Most of the 
bricks were of uniform size. Roofs 
were flat.
 ¾ There is no conclusive evidence of 
the presense of palaces or places of 
worship.

 ¾ Granaries were used to store food grain.
 ¾ The 
remains of wheat, barley, millets, 
sesame and pulses have been found 
there.
The Assembly Hall
The Assembly Hall was another huge 
public building at Mohenjo-Daro. It was a 
multi-pillared hall (20 pillars in 4 rows to 
support the roof).
Trade and Transport
 ¾ Harappans 
were great traders.
 ¾ Standardised weights and measures 
were used by them. They used sticks 
with marks to measure length.
 ¾ House drains passed below many 
lanes before finally emptying into the 
main drains.
 ¾ Every house had its own soak pit, 
which collected all the sediments and 
allowed only the water to flow into the 
street drain.
The Great Bath (Mohenjo-daro)
 ¾ The great bath was a large, rectangular 
tank in a courtyard. It may be the 
earliest example of a water-proof 
structure.
 ¾ The bath was lined with bricks, coated 
with plaster and made water-tight 
using layers of natural bitumen.
 ¾ There were steps on 
the north and south 
leading into the 
tank. There were 
rooms on three 
sides.
 ¾ Water was drawn from the well 
located in the courtyard and drained 
out after use.
The Great Granary (Harappa)
 ¾ The granary was a massive building 
with a solid brick foundation.
A granary with walls made of mud 
bricks, 
which are still in a good 
condition, has been discovered in 
Rakhigarhi, a village in Haryana, 
belonging to Mature Harappan 
Phase.

Leader in Mohenjo-Daro
 ¾ A scul
pture of a 
seated male has 
been unearthed 
in a building, 
with a head band 
on the forehead 
and a smaller 
ornament on the 
right upper arm.
 ¾ His hair is carefully combed, and beard 
finely trimmed.
 ¾ Two holes beneath the ears suggest 
that the head ornament might have 
been attached till the ear.
 ¾ The left shoulder is covered with a 
shawl-like garment decorated with 
designs of flowers and rings.
 ¾ This shawl pattern is used by people 
even today in those areas.
Technology
 ¾ Indus people had developed a system 
of standardised weights and measures.
 ¾ Ivory scale found in Lothal in Gujarat 
is 1704mm (the smallest division 
ever recorded on a scale of other 
contemporary civilisations).
 ¾ They used carts with spokeless solid 
wheels.
 ¾ There is evidence for extensive 
maritime trade with Mesopotamia. 
Indus Seals have been found as far 
as Mesopotamia (Sumer) which are 
modern-day Iraq, Kuwait and parts of 
Syria.
 ¾ King Naram-Sin of Akkadian Empire 
(Sumerian) bought jewellery from 
the land of Melukha (a region of the 
Indus Valley) was mentioned in an 
epic regarding Naram-Sin.
 ¾ Cylindrical seals similar to those found 
in Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia have 
also been found in the Indus area. 
This shows the trade links between 
these two areas.
A naval dockyard has been discovered in 
Lothal in Gujarat. It shows the maritime 
activities of the Indus people.
Dockyard at Lothal
Lothal is situated on the banks of a 
tributary of Sabarmati river in Gujarat.

The word ‘civilisation’ comes from 
the ancient 
Latin word civis, which 
means ‘city’.

This little statue was found at Mohenjo-Daro. 
When Sir J
ohn Marshall saw the statuette 
known as the dancing girl, he said, “When I 
first saw them I found it difficult to believe that 
they were pre-historic modeling. Such as this was unknown in 
the ancient worlds up to the age of Greece. I thought that 
these figures had found their way into levels some 3000 years 
old to which they properly belonged”.
KVT Complex  (Korkai-Vanji-Thondi) spread over Afghanistan and 
Pakistan 
has many places, names of those were mentioned in sangam 
literature.
Korkai, Vanji, Tondi, Matrai, Urai and Kudalgarh are the names of places 
in Pakistan.
Gurkay and Pumpuhar in Afghanistan are related to the cities and ports mentioned in the 
Sangam Age. The names of the rivers Kawri and Poruns in Afghanistan and the rivers 
Kaweri Wala and Phornai in Pakistan also occur in the Sangam literature.

Inscriptions (written in a script of those times) can provide 
us i
nformation about customs, practices and other aspects 
of any place or time. So far, the Indus script has not been 
deciphered. Therefore, we must look for other clues to know 
about the Indus people and their lifestyle.
Apparel
  Cotton fabrics were in common use.
  Clay spindles unearthed suggest that yarn was spun.
  Wool was also used.
Ornaments
  Ornaments were popular among men and women.
  They adorned themselves with necklaces, armlets, bangles, 
finger rings, ear studs and anklets.
  The ornaments were made of gold, silver, ivory, shell, copper, 
terracotta and precious stones.
Do you know The hidden treasures of the Indus civilisation
Love and peace
  Set
tlements were built on giant platforms and elevated 
grounds.
  The Indus Civilisation seems to have been a peaceful one. 
Few weapons were found and there is no evidence of an army.
  They displayed their status with garments and precious 
jewellery.
  They had an advanced civic sense.
Horse and iron were unknown to the 
people of I
ndus. Indus people used the

Religious Belief
We 
don’t have any evidence pointing to specific deities or their 
religious practices. There might have been worship of Mother 
Goddess (which symbolized fertility), which is concluded based 
upon the excavation of several female figurines.
Who Governed them?
Historians believe that there existed a central authority 
that controlled planning of towns and overseas trade, 
maintenance of drainage and peace in the city.
Occupation
  The main occupation of the Indus Civilisation people is 
not known. However, agriculture, handicrafts, pottery 
making,  jewellery making, weaving, carpentry and 
trading were practiced.
  There were merchants, traders and artisans.
  Rearing of cattle was another occupation.
  People of those times knew how to use the potter’s 
wheel.
  They reared domesticated animals.
Pottery
  Pot
tery was practiced using the potter’s wheel. It was 
well fired. Potteries were red in colour with beautiful 
designs in black.
  The broken pieces of pottery have animal figures and 
geometric designs on it.

Teacher: Like Harappa and Mohenjo-
Dar
o in ancient India, there were 
famous towns in ancient Tamilagam too. 
Madurai, Kanchi and Poompuhar are 
prominent among them.
Tamil literature, accounts of foreign 
travellers and archaeological finds provide 
us information about the ancient towns 
of Tamilagam.
Poompuhar
Poompuhar is one of the oldest 
towns in 
ancient Tamilagam. This is the 
place where well known characters of 
Silapathikaram, Kovalan and Kannagi 
lived. It was also a port town along the 
Bay of Bengal. The ports were established 
for facilitating maritime trade. Even in 
times past, countries began to export 
their surplus products and import the 
scarce commodities by sea. Poompuhar 
is one such historic port that emerged in 
the wake of increasing maritime trade. 
It is a coastal town near the present-day 
Mayiladuthurai and is located where the 
river Cauvery drains into the sea. 
Poompuhar Port
Poompuhar was also known by names 
such as Puhar and Kaveripoompattinam. 
It served as the port of the early Chola 
kingdom. One of the popular Sangam 
Literature, Pattinappaalai and Tamil epics, 
Silappathikaram and Manimegalai, have 
references to the brisk sea-borne trade 
that took place in the port 
city, Puhar.
Silappathikaram, in  
particular, speaks about  
the greatness of Poompuhar. 
Teacher: There is. I shall come to that 
later. Let us stand up and wish her first.
Students:  Happy birthday, Tamil.
Tamilini: Thank you all.
Teacher:  Tamil, Is Chennai your 
home town?
Tamilini:  No ma’m. My home town is 
Kadavur near Karur.
Teacher:  Good. Do you have the habit 
of visiting your home town?
Tamilini:  Yes ma’m. Every summer I 
visit my home town.
Teacher:  Excellent! Can you tell me the 
difference between Kadavur 
and Chennai?
Tamilini:   Kadavur is a village. Chennai 
is a city.
Teacher:  Excellent!
Teacher: Can you tell what were the 
earliest planned cities of ancient India?
Students:  Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, 
ma’m.
Teacher: Yes. Very good children. Today 
we are going to study about the ancient 
towns of Tamilagam. They are Poompuhar, 
Madurai, Kanchi. Shall we start?
Students:  Ok ma’m.
Teacher:  See we have started today’s 
lesson with Tamilini’s birthday.
Students: Yes mam.
Mesopotamian

sation is the

The lead female character of Silappathikar am 
is Kannagi. Her father is Maanaigan. Sea 
traders are known by the name Maanaigan. 
The male character Kovalan’s father is 
Maasathuvan. Massathuvan means a 
big trader. It is clear from the text that 
Poompuhar was a place where big traders 
and sea traders had settled down.
Numerous merchants from foreign 
countries such as Greece and Rome 
landed at Poompuhar. Due to busy and 
continuous trade, many of them stayed 
on indefinitely in Poompuhar. There are 
evidences of foreigner's settlements 
in the town. People speaking many 
languages inhabited Poompuhar in its 
glorious days. As loading and unloading 
of ships took some months, the foreign 
traders began to interact with the local 
people during that period. This enabled 
the natives to learn foreign languages for 
communication. Similarly, the foreigners 
also learnt Tamil to communicate with the 
natives. This contact facilitated not only 
exchange of goods but also languages 
and ideas resulting in cultural blending.
The traders of Poompuhar were known 
for their honesty and integrity. They sold 
goods at legitimate prices. Pattinappaalai  
states that “selling any commodity at a 
higher price was considered bad”.
The author of Pattinappaalai, 
Kadiyalur Uruttirangannanar, belonged to 
2nd century BC(BCE). This is indicative of 
Puhar’s antiquity. Horses were imported 
by sea. Pepper was procured through 
the land route. Gold that came from 
Vadamalai was polished and exported 
to the overseas countries. Sandal from 
Western Ghats, pearls from southern 
sea, corals from eastern sea and food 
items from Eelam were imported.
Poompuhar had been built differently 
from other towns. Each social group had 
a separate settlement. Streets were broad 
and straight, dotted with well-designed 
houses. There was also a dockyard.
We can learn about the life of the 
people of Puhar by reading Pattinappaalai 
and “Puhar Kandam” of Silappathikaram.
Puhar was a busy port upto 200 AD(CE). 
It might have been either washed away 
by sea or destroyed by big shore waves. 
The remains of that destruction can still 
be seen in the present Poompuhar town.

last Sangam. Ahil, fragrant wood, was 
brought 
from Port Thondi to Madurai. 
King Solomon of ancient Israel imported 
pearls from Uvari near the Pandyan port, 
Korkai.
A mint of Roman coins was present 
at Madurai. The coins of other countries 
were also minted at Madurai, which is a 
proof for the glory of Madurai.
The fame of Madurai is attested by 
the accounts of the Greek historian 
Megasthanese. Chanakya, Chandragupta’s 
minister, makes a mention of Madurai in 
his book, Arthasastra.
In the moat around the town, tunnels 
had been constructed in such a way that 
even elephants could comfortably enter.
Kanchi
A place of learning is called school. 
Sev
eral schools were established in 
great numbers for the first time in 
Kancheepuram. Jains studied in Jainapalli, 
and Buddhists studied in Viharas.
The greatness of Kanchi as an 
educational centre can be understood 
from the fact that the Chinese traveller 
Hieun Tsang who studied at Nalanda 
Madurai
Madurai has been one of the oldest 
cities 
in India. Its antiquity can be 
understood from the sobriquet “Sangam 
Valartha Nagaram” it has earned. 
Pandyas, the Cholas and later the 
Kalabras ruled Madurai in the ancient 
period. During medieval times, later 
Cholas and later Pandyas followed by 
the Nayaks ruled this historic town. This 
has resulted in cultural blending. Trade 
flourished and evidence for this has been 
unearthed in archaeological excavation 
done in Keezhadi near Madurai.
Madurai is proudly associated with 
tamil sangam (academies), which worked 
for the promotion of Tamil language.  
Forty-nine poets were associated with the 
Thoonga Nagaram
Madurai had Naalangadi and 
Allangadi
.
Naalangadi – Day Market.
Allangadi    – Evening Market.
Madurai is known as Thoonga 
Nagaram (the city that never 
sleeps). Madurai was a safe 
place where women purchased 
things from Allangadi without 
any fear.

of those times. Hundreds of lakes were 
created 
for storing water around the 
town of Kanchi. These lakes were well 
connected with canals. During the later 
period, Kanchi came to be known as the 
district of lakes. Water management skills 
of the ancient Tamils can be understood 
from the construction of Kallanai in the 
Chola country and the lakes and canals in 
Kanchi.
Apart from Poompuhar, Madurai 
and Kanchi, there were other towns 
too in ancient Tamilagam. Korkai, 
Vanchi, Thondi, Uraiyur, Musiri, Karuvur,  
Mamallapuram, Thanjai, Thagadoor and 
Kaayal are some of them. By conducting 
archaeological research, more information 
can be gathered about these places.
Thank you students. With this, we 
shall complete this lesson now.

“Kanchi is the best of the 
towns”. Tamil poet saint Thirunavukarasar 
praises Kanchi as “Kalviyil Karaiillatha 
Kanchi”.
Hieun Tsang remarked that Kanchi 
can be counted as one among the 
seven sacred places like Bodh Gaya 
and Sanchi. Kanchi is the oldest 
town in Thondai Nadu.  Scholars like 
Dharmabalar, Jothibalar, Sumathi and 
Bodhi Dharmar were born in Kanchi.
Kanchi is also known as the temples city. 
The famous temple of great architectural 
beauty, Kailasanathar temple, was built 
by later Pallava king Rajasimha at Kanchi. 
During the Pallava period, a large number 
of cave temples were built. The Buddhist 
monk Manimegalai spent the last part of 
her life at Kanchi speaks highly of that 
town.
Water management played an  
important role in the agrarian society

• Madurai was a trading town.
• Kanchi was an educational 
centre.

Earth is located?
Students :  (Remain silent and after 
sometime they reply in chorus) 
No. We don't know.
Teacher :  Now, let me explain. The Earth 
is the third planet in the Solar 
System. The solar system is in 
the galaxy. It is named as the 
Milkyway Galaxy. There are 
millions of such galaxies in the 
Universe. 
Iniya :  Teacher, shall I say the address 
of our Earth?
Teacher :  Address of our Earth? It's 
interesting Iniya. Tell us the 
address.
Iniya :  Miss. Earth,  
No.3. Solar System, 
Milkyway Galaxy, 
Universe. 
(Everyone clapped and the teacher 
appreciates Iniya.)
Teacher :  That was very good Iniya.  
Now let us know about the solar 
system, galaxy, the Universe 
and all other bodies in detail in 
this lesson.
Numerous stars and celestial bodies 
came into existence by a massive 
explosion called the Big Bang. These 
celestial bodies together are called the 
Universe. It is also referred to as the 
Cosmos. The stars that you see are so 
far away that they appear to be small, 
but they are really huge in size. 
1. Universe 
The Universe is a vast 
expanse of 
space. Most 
astronomers believe that 
the Universe came into 
existence after the Big 
Bang explosion that took 
place about 15 billion years ago. The 
universe consists of billions of galaxies, 
stars, planets, comets, asteroids, 
meteoroids and natural satellites. These 
are collectively called as celestial bodies, 
which are located far away from each 
other. A Light year is the unit used 
to measure the distance between the 
celestial bodies. 
Galaxy 
A galaxy is a huge cluster of stars which 
are held together by gravitational force. 
Most of the galaxies are scattered in space, 
 The study of the 
Univ
erse is called 
Cosmology. The 
term Cosmos is 
derived from the Greek word ‘Kosmos’.

162
Andromeda galaxy is the nearest to the 
Earth apart 
from the ‘Magellanic Clouds’ 
galaxy.
2. The Solar System
The word ‘solar’ is derived from the 
Roman 
word ‘ sol’, which means ‘Sun 
God’. The solar system is believed to have 
formed about 4.5 billion years ago. The 
solar system is a gravitationally bound 
system which comprises of the Sun, the 
eight planets, dwarf planets, satellites, 
comets, asteroids and meteoroids. 
but some remain in groups. The Milky Way 
Galaxy was formed about 5 billion years 
after the Big Bang explosion. Our solar 
system is a part of the Milky Way galaxy. 
Activity:

um. a) Share your experience 
in the class room. b) Make an album 
of interesting facts about the solar 
system.
A light-year is the 
distance 
travelled by 
light in a year. Light 
travels at a velocity of 
300,000 km per second. Sound travels 
at a speed of 330 m per second.

The Sun
The Sun 
is at the 
centre of the solar 
system. Each member 
of the solar system 
revolves around the 
Sun. The Sun is so 
huge, that it accounts for 99.8 percent of 
the entire mass of the solar system. The 
Sun is made up of extremely hot gases like 
Hydrogen and Helium. 
The Sun is a star. It is self-luminous; 
it gives light on its own. The surface 
temperature of the Sun is about 
6,000° C. It is the source of light and 
heat energy to the entire solar system. 
Sunlight takes about 8.3 minutes to 
reach the Earth.
Planets
The word 'planet' 
means wanderer . 
There are eight planets 
in the solar system. 
They are Mercury, 
Venus, Earth, Mars, 
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. All 
the planets rotate anti-clockwise (from 
west to east) on their own axes except 
Venus and Uranus. The elliptical path in 
which the planets move around the Sun is 
known as orbit. The eight planets revolve 
in their respective orbits because of the 
gravitational pull of the Sun. They do not 
move out of their paths or away from the 
solar system.
The four planets nearer to the Sun 
are called Inner or Terrestrial Planets  
(Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars). The inner 
planets are comparatively smaller in size 
and are composed of rocks. The surface of 
inner planets has mountains, volcanoes and 
craters. The last four planets are called as 
Outer Planets or Jovian Planets (Jupiter, 
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). They are also 
called Gaseous Giants. An asteroid belt is 
found between Mars and Jupiter. 
Mnemonic to remember the order 
of planets:
 My Very Educated Mother 
Just Showed Us Neptune. 
Mercury (The Nearest Planet)
Mercury 
is the 
smallest and closest 
planet to the Sun. 
It is named after 
the Roman deity 
‘Mercury’, the 
messenger to the 
Gods. It is an airless 
and waterless planet. It does not have an 
atmosphere and so experiences extremes 
of temperature. It has no natural satellites. 
Mercury can be viewed in the morning and 
evening with the naked eye.
Mercury
Sun
GEO CONNECT: The ancient Tamils 
knew that 
the planets revolved 
around the Sun. For example, in Tamil 
literature Sirupanatruppadai, the 
line ’வாள் நிற விசும்பின் க�ாள் மீன் 
சூழ்ந்த இளங�திர் ஞாயிறு’  mentions 
that the Sun is surrounded by 
planets. 
1.3 million Earths can fit 
inside 
the Sun. Imagine 
how big the Sun is.
TN_GOVT_GEOGRAPHY_VI_Std_Ch1.indd   163 23/12/2021   12:07:42
164
Venus (The Hottest Planet)
Venus is the 
second 
planet from 
the Sun. It is called 
the Earth’s twin, 
as it is almost the 
same size as the 
Earth. It has the 
longest rotation period 
(243 days) among the planets in the Solar 
system. It rotates in the opposite direction 
to all other planets, except Uranus. It 
has no natural satellites, like Mercury. 
It is named after the Roman goddess of 
love and beauty. It is often visible in the 
mornings and the evenings and so it is 
frequently called as the Morning Star and 
the Evening Star. After the Moon, it is the 
brightest natural object in the night sky. 
Earth (The Living Planet)
The Earth is 
the third planet 
from the Sun and 
the fifth largest 
planet in the solar 
system. It is called 
the ‘blue planet’ 
or ‘watery planet’ 
because three-fourth of the Earth is 
covered by water. The Earth is the only 
planet in the solar system which is not 
named after any Greek or Roman deity. It 
is the only planet known to support life. 
Life is possible on Earth because of the 
Venus
Earth
presence of land, air and water. The polar 
diameter of 
the Earth is 12,714 km and 
the equatorial diameter is 12,756 km. 
The Earth revolves around the Sun at a 
speed of about 30 km per second. The 
only natural satellite of the Earth is the 
Moon. 
The distance between 
the Sun 
and the Earth 
is about 150 million 
kilometre. A flight flying at a speed of 
800 km per hour from the Earth would 
take 21 years to reach the Sun.
Mars (The Red Planet)
Mars is 
the fourth 
planet from the 
Sun and the second 
smallest planet in 
the solar system, 
after Mercury. It 
is named after the 
Roman God of war. It appears red in colour 
due to the presence of iron oxide on its 
surface. So, it is often described as the 
Red Planet . It has a thin atmosphere. 
It also has polar ice caps like the Earth.  
Mars
HOTS: Even though Mercury is the 
nearest 
planet to the Sun, Venus is 
the hottest one. Guess why?
On 24th September, 2014 Mangalyan 
(Mars 
Orbiter Mission - MOM), 
launched by the Indian Space 
Research Organization (ISRO), 
reached the orbit of Mars to analyze 
its atmosphere and topography. ISRO 
has now become the fourth space 
agency to reach Mars after the Soviet 
Space programme, NASA and the 
European Space Agency.
TN_GOVT_GEOGRAPHY_VI_Std_Ch1.indd   164 23/12/2021   12:07:47
165
Mars has two natural satellites namely 
Phobos and 
Deimos. Many orbiters and 
rovers have been launched to explore this 
planet. 
Jupiter (the Largest Planet)
Jupiter is the 
fifth planet from the 
Sun and the largest 
planet in the solar 
system. It is named 
after the king of the 
Roman gods. It is the 
third brightest object 
in the night sky, after moon and Venus. It 
is the fastest spinning planet in the solar 
system. It is called a gas giant planet. Its 
atmosphere is mostly made up of Hydrogen 
and Helium like the Sun. It has the largest 
number of natural satellites. Io, Europa, 
Ganymede and Callisto are a few large 
satellites of Jupiter.
Saturn (The Ringed Planet)
Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun 
and the second largest planet in the solar 
system, after Jupiter. It is named after the 
Roman god of agriculture. Saturn has many 
rings around it. These rings are huge and 
are mostly made up of ice, rocks and dust 
particles. 
Saturn
Saturn has 62 natural satellites around 
it. 
Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, is the only 
Jupiter
satelli
te in the solar system that has clouds 
and a dense atmosphere composed of 
nitrogen and methane. The specific gravity 
of Saturn is less than that of water.
 Uranus (The Somersaulting Planet)
Uranus is the 
seventh planet from 
the Sun. It was the 
first to be discovered 
with a telescope 
by the astronomer 
William Herschel in 
1781. It appears 
green due to the presence of methane 
gas. It is named after the Greek god of 
the sky. It rotates on its axis from east to 
west like Venus. Its axis is tilted so much 
that, it appears to orbit the Sun on its sides 
like a rolling ball. Uranus has 27 natural 
satellites, of which Titania is the largest.
Neptune (The Coldest Planet)
Neptune is the 
eighth and the 
farthest planet 
from the Sun. 
There are strong 
winds in this 
planet. It is named 
after the Roman god 
of sea. Neptune has 14 natural satellites, 
the largest being Triton. Because of its 
distance from the Sun, Neptune is one of 
the coldest planets in the solar system. 
Neptune
HOTS: If you could put Saturn in a 
lar
ge enough ocean it would float. 
Guess why?

The striking blue and white features 
of Neptune 
help to distinguish it from 
Uranus.
HOTS: Imagine you were on a space 
craft 
travelling at the speed of light 
from Earth, how long would it take to 
reach the Sun?
The Dwarf Planets
Dwarf 
planets are small celestial 
bodies found beyond the planet Neptune. 
They are extremely cold and dark. They 
are almost spherical in shape, but unlike 
planets they can share their orbit with 
other dwarf planets. The five dwarf 
planets of the solar system are Pluto, 
Ceres, Eris, Makemake and Haumea. 
The Moon - Earth’s Satellite
Satellites are 
celestial objects, 
which revolve 
around the 
planets. The moon 
is the Earth’s 
only satellite. It 
revolves around 
the Earth once in every 27 days and 
8 hours. It takes about the same time for 
it to complete one rotation around its axis. 
It has no atmosphere. The surface of the 
moon is characterized by craters created 
by the impact of meteors. The distance 
between the moon and the Earth is 
about 3, 84,400 km. The size of the moon 
is one-quarter of the Earth. The Moon 
is the only celestial body where humans 
have landed. 
Moon
HOTS: We see only one side of the 
Moon 
always. Why?
Asteroids
Asteroids 
are small solid objects that 
move around the Sun. They are found as 
a belt between Mars and Jupiter. They are 
too small to be called as planets. They 
are also known as Planetoids or Minor 
Planets.

on, Chandrayaan - 1  in 2008. 
Fact:
Comets
A comet 
is a celestial object made up 
of a head and a tail. The head of a comet 
consists of solid particles held together 
by ice and the tail is made up of gases. 
Halley’s Comet is the most famous comet 
which comes close to the Earth every 76 
years. It appeared in 1986 and will appear 
in 2061.
Comets
Meteors and Meteorites
A meteor 
is a stone like or metallic 
body. When entering into the Earth’s 
atmosphere, most of them burn. As they 
often appear as streaks of light in the sky, 
they are also known as Shooting Stars.

Meteors which strike the Earth’s surface 
are 
called meteorites. 
3. Motions of the Earth
Have you noticed the Sun in the morning, 
afternoon or 
evening? Is it in the same 
place throughout the day? No. It is seen 
in the east in the morning, overhead in the 
afternoon and in the west in the evening. 
Have you ever thought of the reason behind 
it? This is because of the constant moving 
of the Earth around the Sun. It seems that 
the Sun is moving, but it is not so. This is 
similar to what you experience when you 
are travelling in a bus or train. When you 
look out of the window, the trees, lamp 
posts and other objects seem to be moving, 
but actually it is you who are moving. To 
understand the motions of the Earth better, 
you need to be familiar with the shape and 
inclination of the Earth.
Shape and Inclination of the Earth
The Earth is spherical in shape. It 
rotates on its axis, which is an imaginary 
line that runs from the North Pole to the 
South Pole passing through the centre of 
the Earth. The Earth’s axis is always tilted 
or inclined from the vertical by an angle 
of 23½°. It makes an angle of 66½° with 
the plane of the Earth’s orbit. 
The velocity of the Earth’s rotation 
vari
es from 1,670 km per hour at the 
equator to 845 km per hour at 60° N 
and S latitudes and zero at the poles.
Fact:
Rotation
It is 
the spinning 
movement of the 
Earth on its axis. 
The Earth rotates 
from west to east 
(anti-clockwise) 
and takes 23 hours 
56 minutes and 
4.09 seconds to 
complete one rotation. The time taken by 
the Earth to complete one rotation is called 
a day. The rotation of the Earth causes 
day and night. As the Earth is spherical in 
shape, only one half of it is illuminated by 
the Sun at a time. The other half remains 
dark. The illuminated portion of the Earth 
experiences day, whereas the darkened 
part of the Earth experiences night. The 
line which divides the surface of the Earth 
into a lighted half and a dark half is called 
the Terminator Line.
The Midnight Sun  is a natural 
phenomenon that occurs in the 
summer months in places north of the 
Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic 
Circle, when the Sun remains overhead 
24 hours a day. 
Fact:
Revolution
It is the mov
ement of the Earth 
around the Sun on its elliptical path. The 
Earth takes 365 ¼ days to complete one 
revolution. It revolves around the Sun at a 
speed of 30 km per second. For the sake 
of convenience, we take it as 365 days and 
TN_GOVT_GEOGRAPHY_VI_Std_Ch1.indd   168 23/12/2021   12:07:54
169
revolution gives the impression that the 
Sun is 
continuously moving north and 
south of the equator. The equator faces 
the Sun directly on 21 March and 23 
September. These two days are called 
Equinoxes , during which the day and 
night are equal throughout the Earth. 
Perihelion is the 
Earth’s closest position 
to the Sun. Aphelion 
is the farthest position 
of the Earth from the Sun. 
On 21 st June, the Tropic of Cancer 
f
aces the Sun. This is known as Summer 
Solstice. It is the longest day in the 
Northern Hemisphere and longest 
night (shortest day) in the Southern 
Hemisphere. On 22nd December, the Tropic 
of Capricorn faces the Sun. It is called as 
Winter Solstice . It is the longest day 
in the Southern Hemisphere and longest 
night (shortest day) in the Northern 
Hemisphere. 
call it a year. The remaining quarter day 
is added once in every four years in the 
month of February. That is why February 
has 29 days once in four years. It is called 
a Leap Year. The inclination of the Earth 
on its axis and its revolution around the 
Sun cause different seasons. 
Activity:
Circle the leap years: 2000, 2005, 
2012, 2014

The Northern Hemisphere is inclined 
towar
ds the Sun for six months from 21 st 
March to 23rd September while the Southern 
Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun.

4. Spheres of the Earth
The Earth is the most suitable planet 
to support 
life. It has three major 
components that we call as the realms of 
the Earth- lithosphere, hydrosphere and 
atmosphere. The three components along 
with suitable climate make life possible on 
Earth. All living things exist in a narrow 
zone called the biosphere. Now let us have 
a close look at each of the spheres.
Lithosphere
The word lithosphere is derived from 
the Greek word Lithos, which means 
rocky. The Lithosphere is the land on 
which we live. It is the solid outer layer 
of the Earth consisting of rocks and soil.
Hydrosphere
The word Hydro means water in 
Greek. The hydrosphere consists of water 
bodies such as oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, 
ice caps on mountains and water vapour 
in the atmosphere.
Atmosphere
The word Atmo means air in Greek. 
Atmosphere is the envelope of air that 
surrounds the Earth. Different types of 
gases make up the atmosphere. The 
major gases are Nitrogen (78%) and 
Oxygen (21%). The other gases like 
Carbon dioxide, Hydrogen, Helium, 
Argon and Ozone are present in meager 
amounts. 
Biosphere
The narrow belt of interaction among 
the lithosphere, the hydrosphere and the 
atmosphere, where life exists is known 
as Biosphere. Bio means life in Greek. It 
consists of distinct zones. Each zone has its 
own climate, plant and animal life. These 
zones are known as ecosystems.
The Gulf of Mannar 
Biospher
e Reserve in 
the Indian Ocean covers 
an area of 10,500 sq.km  
     in the ocean.

Pathway
 This lesson focuses on the land and oceans found on Earth. It deals 
with 
the classification of landforms - first, second and third order landforms.
Learning Objectives
• To understand the continents and oceans
•  
To learn about the characteristic features of different landforms 
and oceans
• To know about the classification of landforms
• To understand the oceans and its features

A group pastes the continents and 
comes first 
with the chart without any gaps 
in between the continents. The teacher 
then puts the chart on the board and the 
children applaud. 
"What kind of picture is this? Once I 
have seen one like this in the atlas, "  says 
Yazhini. 
"You are right. This is Pangea, the 
Super Continent, and the Sea around 
is Panthalasa . It was 200 million 
years ago, when these landmasses 
moved away from each other to gain 
the present position as continents and 
oceans." says the teacher. 
"What makes it to move madam?" asks 
Nila.
"Nothing other than the internal heat of 
the Earth," says the teacher and continues, 
“this lesson deals about the continents and 
oceans in detail”.
The Earth is covered by water 
which occupies 71 percent and land  
that occupies 29 percent of the Earth’s 
surface. The surface of the Earth is not 
even, because it has lofty mountains, 
deep oceans and other landforms.  
These landforms can be classified as:
1. First order landforms
Continents and oceans are grouped as 
first or
der landforms. The vast land masses 
on Earth are called Continents and huge 
water bodies are called Oceans. There are 
seven continents. They are Asia, Africa, 
North America, South America, 
Antarctica, Europe and Australia . Asia 
is the largest continent, whereas Australia 
is the smallest one.

2. Second order landforms
The second order landforms are 
categorised 
as mountains, plateaus and 
plains. 
2.1 Mountains
A landf
orm that rises 
600 metre above its 
surroundings and has 
steep slopes is called a 
mountain. Mountains 
are found in isolation or in 
groups. If the mountains 
extend for a larger area continuously, it 
is called a mountain range. These ranges 
stretch for hundreds or thousands of 
kilometre. The Himalayas of Asia, the 
Rocky Mountains of North America and

the Andes of South America are such 
examples. The Andes mountain in South 
America is the longest mountain range 
(7,000 km) in the world. The highest 
point of a mountain is known as its 
peak. Mt. Everest is the highest peak 
(8,848 m) in the world. Which country is 
Mt. Everest located in? 
Mountains are the sources of rivers. 
They provide shelter to flora and fauna. 
Here, tourism is an important activity. 
During summer, people go to mountain 
regions to enjoy the pleasing cool 
weather. Udhagamandalam, Kodaikanal, 
Kolli hills, Yercaud and Yelagiri are some 
of the hill stations found in Tamil Nadu. 
2.2 Plateaus
Plateaus are the elev
ated portions of 
the Earth that have flat surfaces bounded 
by steep slopes. The elevation of plateaus 
may be a few hundred or several thousand 
metres. Tibetan Plateau  is the highest 
plateau in the world. So, it is called as the 
‘Roof of the world’. The flat topped part 
of the plateau is called Tableland. The 
plateaus are generally rich in minerals. 
The Chotanagpur Plateau is one of the 
mineral rich plateaus in India. Therefore, 
mining is one of the major activities of the 
people living here. The Deccan Plateau in 
peninsular India is of volcanic origin. 
2.3 Plains
Plai
ns are flat and relatively low-lying 
lands. Plains are usually less than 200 
metre above sea level. Sometimes they 
may be rolling or undulating. Most plains 
are formed by rivers and their tributaries 
and distributaries. These plains are 
used extensively for agriculture due to 
the availability of water and fertile soil.  
HOTS: You know the importance of 
conservation of f
orests. Do you think 
conservation of mountains is also 
equally important?

from the earliest times. 
For example: the Indus in India, the 
Nile valley in Egypt are some of the 
early civilisations which developed 
and flourished.

They are most suitable for human 
inhabi
tation. Hence, they are the highly 
populated regions of the world. The oldest 
civilisations like the Mesopotamian and the 
Indus civilisations developed in river plains. 
The Indo-Gangetic plain in North India is 
one of the largest plains in the world. The 
plains formed by river Cauvery and Vaigai 
are important plains found in Tamil Nadu. 
Coastal plains are the low lying lands 
adjacent to oceans and seas.
3. Third order landforms
Third order landforms are formed on 
mountains, plateaus 
and plains mainly 
by erosional and depositional activities of 
rivers, glaciers, winds and waves. Valleys, 
beaches and sand dunes are some examples 
of third order landforms.

landf
orms.

Erosion is the process of removal 
of 
surface material from the Earth's 
crust. The eroded materials are  
transported and deposited on the low 
lying areas. This process is called as 
Deposition.

4. Oceans 
The Earth looks blue when we see it 
fr
om space. This is because, two-thirds 
of it is covered by water. The water is 
found in oceans and seas. Oceans are 
vast expanse of water. Seas are water 
bodies partially or fully enclosed by land. 
As you have studied previously, there are 
five main oceans in the world.
4.1 The Pacific Ocean
The P
acific Ocean 
is the largest and 
deepest ocean on the 
Earth. It covers about 
one-third of the Earth’s 
total area and spreads for about 168.72 
million 
sq.km. It is bounded by Asia and 
Australia in its west and North America 
and South America in its east. It stretches 
from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the 
Southern Ocean in the south. 
This ocean’s shape is roughly 
triangular with its apex in the north at 
the Bering Strait which connects the 
Pacific Ocean with the Arctic Ocean. The 
Bering Sea, the China Sea, the Sea of 
Japan, Tasman Sea and the Philippine 
Sea are some of the marginal seas of the 
Pacific Ocean. Indonesia, Philippines, 
Japan, Hawaii, New Zealand are some 
of the islands located in this Ocean. 
The deepest point Mariana Trench  is 
10,994 m - and is located in the Pacific 
Ocean. A chain of volcanoes is located 
around the Pacific Ocean called the 
Pacific Ring of Fire.

The I
ndian Ocean is the third largest ocean 
on the Earth’s surface. It covers an area of 
about 70.56 million sq.km. It is named after 
India. It is triangular in shape and bounded 
by Africa in the west, Asia in the north and 
Australia in the east. The Andaman and 
Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Maldives, 
Sri Lanka, Mauritius and the Reunion Islands  
are some of the islands located in the Indian 
Ocean. Malacca strait connects the Indian 
Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.

The Atlanti
c Ocean is the second 
largest ocean on Earth. It covers one sixth 
of the Earth’s total area and spreads for 
about 85.13 million sq.km . It is bounded 
by North America and South America in 
the west and Europe and Africa in the 
east. Like the Pacific, it stretches from 
the Arctic Ocean in the north to the 
Southern Ocean in the south. The shape 
of the Atlantic Ocean resembles the letter 
‘S’. The Strait of Gibraltar connects the 
Atlantic Ocean with the Mediterranean 
Sea. The Atlantic Ocean is the busiest 
shipping route between the Eastern and 
Western hemispheres. The deepest point 
is the Milwaukee Deep  in the Puerto 
Rica Trench. It has a depth of about 8600 
m-. The Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico,

Understanding 
Diversity
Learning Objectives
• Know the meaning of diversity
• Understand 
the existence of diversity in India
• Develop a healthy attitude towards others around you
• Understand the differences in the belief systems of people
• Know to accept and respect the unity in diversity
1. Understanding diversity
Take a look around your class. Do you 
see an
y of your classmates who looks 
similar? Look at the table.
From the below table, we understand 
that the three students are different from 
one another. This shows that people 
speak different languages, eat different 
kinds of food, celebrate their own 
festivals and practice a culture different 
from one another. Similarly, people who 
live in different parts of our country differ 
in their ways of life. These differences 
make us unique as Indians. We come 
from different backgrounds, belong to 
different cultures, worship in different

land forms and lifestyles diversity, social 
div
ersity, religious diversity, linguistic 
diversity and cultural diversity.
2.1  Land Forms and Lifestyle 
Diversity
A continent is a very large area of 
land 
with various physical features such 
as mountains, plateaus, plains, rivers 
and seas and various types of weather 
patterns. India has all of them. India is 
known as a sub-continent. These features 
have an underlying influence upon the 
people who live in different landforms of 
the country.
Physical and climatic features 
determine the economic activities of a 
region. People living in the plains thrive 
on agriculture, while people in the coastal 
areas take to fishing for their livelihood. In 
mountainous regions, rearing of animals is 
undertaken. Hilly landscapes are supported 
ways, yet we live together. This is known 
as diversity.
2. Diversity in India
India is a home to a civilisation that 
is 
5,000 years old. Different groups of 
people from different parts of the world 
were attracted towards India over the 
years because of its wealth. Some came 
for trade with the local people and others 
were keen on invading its territory. So 
diverse races of people migrated into 
India by land and sea routes over time. 
Thus the Dravidians, Negroids, Aryans, 
Alpines and Mongoloids became part of 
the modern Indian race. Then, the people 
who migrated to India also moved to 
other parts of the country. This movement 
and migration of people is the reason for 
India’s rich diversity.
We will now study the diversity in 
India under the following broad headings: 
UNITY IN DIVERSITY

• Jaisalmer  located in Rajasthan, is the land of lowest rainfall.
by favourable climatic conditions for the 
cultiv
ation of coffee and tea.
Diversity in landforms also impacts the 
flora and fauna of a region. The plant and 
animal wealth of a place depends upon 
the natural habitat and the climate that 
prevails in that region. Food, clothing, 
occupation and livelihood of the people 
is closely connected with the region’s 
natural surroundings and climate.
2.2 Social Diversity
2.2.
1   Interdependence and  
Co-existence
A communit
y is a place where people 
live together with a common interest or 
heritage. Our community is made up of 
peasants, labourers, artisans, parents, 
teachers, students and many others. For 
a comfortable livelihood, communities 
depend on each other.

types of landforms.

2.2.2 Family and Society
Families consti
tute the fundamental 
unit of a society. There are two types 
of families: joint families and nuclear 
families. Families live in a harmonious 
neighbourhood. Many of neighbourhoods 
collectively form a village and many of 
them group together in a city. The needs 
of people and the interdependence of 
communities for amenities such as water, 
food, electricity, education, housing 
and so on bring us together to live in 
harmony. Though we are diverse in our 
cultural practices, we are united and 
interdependent socially.
2.3 Religious Diversity
India is a secular country. It does not 
declar
e any religion as state religion. The 
freedom of religion is our fundamental right. 
India is the birth place of many religions 
Toda tribal people.
and has 
become the home of many others. 
Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, 
Buddhism, Jainism and Zoroastrianism 
flourish in India.
India is a land of festivals, where 
people from different religions engage in 
many colourful celebrations in different 
parts of the country and co-exist 
harmoniously. The wide variety of festivals 
celebrated in India is a true manifestation 
of its rich culture and traditions. 
Festivals like Pongal, Deepavali, Holi, 
Vijayadhasami, AyudhaPuja, Navaratri, 
Durga Puja, Dussehra, Ganesh Chaturthi, 
Bihu, Kumbamela, Onam, Miladi Nabi, 
Ramzan, Christmas, Buddha Poornima, 
Mahavir Jayanthi, Guru Nanak Jayanthi 
and Rakshabandhan are some of the 
festivals that denote the cultural diversity 
of India.

three hundred years before independence 
in 
1947, the English language gained 
prominence in India. In due course, English 
has emerged as an important language 
and a medium of instruction in schools 
and colleges. It is widely used in official 
communication and daily life.
2.4 Linguistic Diversity
According to census of India 2001, 
India has 122 
major languages and 
1599 other languages. Four major 
Indian language families are Indo-Aryan, 
Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino Tibetian. 
Tamil is the oldest Dravidian language.
Top Five languages spoken in 
India (as per 
2011 Census)

Bengali 8.30 %
Telugu 6.93 %
Marathi 7.09 %
Tamil 5.89 %
Historically, the Portuguese, the Dutch, 
the British, the Danish and the French came 
to India for trade and their occupation of 
India or some parts of it has left behind 
a certain impact upon the culture and 
language of the people. Because the British

2.5 Cultural Diversity
The term ‘culture’ refers to customs 
and pr
actices of people, their language, 
their dress code, cuisine, religion, social 
habits, music, art and architecture.
The Constitution 
of I
ndia recognises 
twenty-two languages 
as official languages. 
The Government of India has declared 
Tamil as the first classical language in 
2004. Apart from Tamil, five other Indian 
languages have been declared as the 
classical languages, by the Goverment 
of India. Sankrit, Telugu, Kannada, 
Malayalam, Oriya were announced as 
classical language in 2005, 2008, 2008 
2013, 2016 respectively.

community. Each of the 28 states and 9 
Union 
territories of India has rich traditions 
and unique ways of artistic expression.
2.5.1  Popular Dances and  
Music of India
In
 ancient times, dance was considered 
as a way to celebrate, worship and also as 
a gesture of thanks giving and joy. Dances 
of India reflect its cultural richness.
Music and dance go hand in hand. 
There are several styles of music practiced 
in India. The Hindustani music, Karnatic 
music, Classical Tamil Music, Folk Music, 
Lavani, Ghazl are some of them. There are 
songs from various languages composed 
by blending these different forms of music.
The culture of a group of people is 
reflected in their social behaviour and 
interactions. The group identity fostered 
by social patterns is unique to a group.
Art and architecture are an integral 
part of every community. It develops 
as a part of culture and tradition of a 
About 60 percent of 
the total
 epigraphical 
inscriptions found by 
the Archaeological 
Survey of India (ASI) are from Tamil 
Nadu, and most of these are in the 
Tamil script.

as an ‘Ethnological
 
museum’, as a great 
variety of racial

Summary
  India is the land of unity in diversity.
  Di
versity is a state of being different 
from each other.
  Landforms and climate have an impact 
on diversity.
  Physical features and climatic 
conditions determine the economic 
activities of a region.
  Diversity in landforms also impacts 
the flora and fauna of a region.
  Linguistic, religious, social and cultural 
diversity exists in India.
  India is a sub-continent with all the 
physical features of a continent.
  According to census of India 2001, 
India has 122 major languages and 
1599 other languages.
3. Unity in Diversity
Though diversity is visible in every 
aspect of 
life in India, we are united by the 
spirit of patriotism. Symbols such as the 
National Flag and National Anthem remind 
us of our great nation and the need to stay 
united. Celebration of landmark events 
such as Independence Day, Republic Day 
and Gandhi Jayanthi every year bring us 
together and keep the spirit of one nation 
alive within us.
India is known for 
‘unit
y in diversity’. This 
phrase was coined by 
Jawaharlal Nehru, the

Learning Objectives
•  Know the meanings of prejudice and stereotypes
•  Understand discrimination and inequali
ty
•  Become aware of the negative consequences of discrimination
The society that we live in comprises 
people f
rom various social groups who are 
different in many ways. Since we believe 
in ‘Unity in Diversity’, we should have 
been living peacefully with one another 
irrespective of those differences. Often, 
we see that diversity is not accepted, and 
people show attitudes of hostility towards 
those who are ‘different’ from them. They 
form opinions about the other groups and 
this often leads to tension in the society. 
Such ‘opinions’ are often ‘prejudiced’.
1. Prejudice
Prejudice means to judge other people 
in a 
negative or inferior manner, without 
knowing much about them. It happens 
when people have false belief and ideas.
Prejudice   
   Pre 1 Judge
The 
word ‘prejudice’ refers to 
prejudgement. Prejudices can be based 
on many things like people’s religious 
beliefs, the region they come from, the 
colour of their skin, language, their 
accent or the clothes they wear. The 
types of prejudice are gender prejudice, 
racial prejudice, class prejudice, disability 
prejudice and so on.
For example, urban people are more 
civilised than rural people in attitudes 
and behaviour, is one such prejudice.
1.1 Causes for Prejudice
Some 
common social factors that 
contributes to the rise of prejudice are
1. Socialisation
2. Conforming behaviours
3. Economic benefits

4. Authoritarian personality
5. Ethno–centri
sm
6. Group closure
7. Conflicts
2. Stereotypes
When prejudice gets 
str
onger, it develops into 
a stereotype. Stereotype is a false view 
or idea about something. For example, 
girls are not good at sports. Stereotype 
is learned at a very early age, and 
children grow to have very strong ideas 
or opinions about things, groups or 
ideologies. As children grow up, the lines 
of like and hate for other things, people, 
cultures, beliefs, languages become 
sharper.
Example
Ragu was hit in his eye 
with 
a soft ball and to 
everyone’s surprise, 
he started to cry. The 
others started to laugh at him; Mani felt 
sad for him but started laughing along 
with others.
In the above example, we have a 
general opinion that girls cry and boys 
don’t cry. When Ragu cried out of pain, 
others laughed at him. Now we understand 
that when we fix people in our image, we 
create a stereotype. 
Gender-based stereotypes are often 
portrayed in films, advertisements and 
TV serials. Almost all the advertisements 
related to detergents, washing 
machines, dishwashers and others show 
a woman as the main lead or user of 
that product. On the other hand, all the

country and leading 
the fight for human 
rights around the 
world.

performed by ferocious looking men.
3. Inequality and Discrimination
Inequality means difference in treatment. 
The different forms of inequalities such as 
caste inequality, religious inequality, race 
inequality or gender inequality give rise to 
discrimination.
Discrimination can be defined as 
negative actions towards people. 
Inequality and untouchability are caused 
by discriminations based on caste, religion 
and gender. Treating dark-skinned people 
differently from fair-skinned people, 
and denying equal status, rights and 
opportunities on the basis of colour, caste, 
gender, religion etc. are the formidable 
discriminatory trends afflicting India.
Article 15(1) of the Constitution states 
that the State shall not discriminate 
against any citizen on grounds of religion, 
race, caste, sex, place of birth.

to college after finishing her schooling. 
Simil
arly, most of the girls are not 
allowed to select a career of their choice 
rather they are forced into marriage. In 
some families, girls are not allowed to 
wear modern dresses while boys in such 
families often wear modern dresses.
3.3 Religious Discrimination
Re
ligious discrimination is unequal 
treatment of an individual or group based 
on their beliefs. Religious discrimination 
has been around for a long time. There 
have been problems between people 
of different religions for thousands of 
years. Our Constitution has provided 
equality for all irrespective of their caste, 
religion, language, place of birth etc. 
Yet discriminations are still in practice 
even in worship places on the basis of 
caste, religion, gender and language. 
Our great social thinkers have been 
crusading against such discriminations 
and inequalities.
3.1 Caste Discrimination
Ca
ste system is the most dominant 
reason for inequality and discrimination in 
India. The caste system originated in the 
Varna system of the Vedic Aryan society. 
In the beginning Varna was an occupation 
based flexible social division. In the Later 
Vedic Society, the Varna system was 
expanded into a rigid, discriminatory, 
birth based graded caste divisions. 
Many people in India have fought against 
caste oppression. The most prominent 
among them was Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. 
He belonged to a such depressed family 
and suffered discrimination throughout 
his childhood. He fought actively for the 
annihilation of caste so as to ensure equality 
among all the citizens of India.
3.2 Gender Discrimination
Ge
nder discrimination refers to 
health, education, economic and political 
inequalities between men and women. 
For example, A girl is not allowed to go 
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar
• He 
is popularly known as Baba Saheb.
•  He was an Indian jurist, economist, politician and 
social reformer.
•  He earned his M.A. in 1915 and then obtained a D.Sc at the 
London School of Economics before being awarded Ph.D by 
Columbia University in 1927.
• He served as the chairman of drafting committee of the 
constituent assembly and hence regarded as the father of Indian 
Constitution.
• He was independent India’s first Law Minister.
• He was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1990.

3.4 Socio-Economic Inequality
In 
the socio-economic field, the benefits 
of growth have not been spread evenly. 
The low-income districts are associated 
with low industrial development, low 
agricultural productivity and low human 
development. Similarly, the Districts with 
low literacy rate are found to be with lower 
sex ratio.
3.5  Remedial Measures for 
Abolishing Inequality and
 
Discrimination
The remedial measures for abolishing 
inequality and discrimination in Indian 
society are as follows.

of rul
es and regulations by which a 
nation would function. Equality is where 
untouchability is seen as a crime. In

abolished and it's any form is forbidden.
Even today, different types of 
discrimination are reported across the 
country. Women, peasants, tribes and 
people from lower social classes are still 
striving for equality in India.
